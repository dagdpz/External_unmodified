function [fh,dh] = stampit(fd_flag)

% The Stampit function places a file and/or date stamp on the bottom
% of all open figures windows.  It must be called at the end of an m-file
% (otherwise the m-file name is []). If f_flag is 'f' then only the filename
% is placed on the figures, if d_flag = 'd' then only the date is stamped in
% the figure windows.  
%
% fh and dh are the corresponding handles of the filename and date text
% within each of the figure windows.  
%
% Call: [fh,dh]=stampit('f');

%
% Revision List:
%  - addition of hidn_axis was added to properly locate the 
%    filename and date at the bottom of the overall figure window (DMP/TAB)
%  - addition of cur_ax in order to set the current axes handle back to its
%    original state (before Stampit is called) (DEK/TAB)
%  - addition of cur_fig in order to reset the current figure back to its 
%    original state (before Stampit was called) (TAB 11/7/01)
%  - place the handle for the hidden stampit axis to the bottom of the 
%    figure's Children handle list -- this should solve problems with the zoom
%    function and other functions after stampit has been called (TAB 11/13/01)
%  - used st(length(st)).name instead of st(2,1).name so that the original m-file
%    that is run is the one printed on the plots (ie. NOT a function's name in
%    case the figures are generated within a function call) (TAB 12/17/01)
