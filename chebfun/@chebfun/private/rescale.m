function [x,I] = rescale(x,ends)
% RESCALE Rescale values from [-1,1].
% RESCALE(X,ENDS), where ENDS is a vector with increasing values, 
% rescales X from the interval [ENDS(i) ENDS(i+1)] where it is contained to
% the interval [-1 1]. In case that X is a matrix, each element of X is 
% rescaled using the appropriate interval of ENDS where it is contained.
%
% [Y,I] = RESCALE(X,ENDS) returns the rescaled values Y and the index i
% of the vector ENDS used to rescale X.
