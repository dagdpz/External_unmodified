</pre><p>A more substantial example of rootfinding involving a Bessel function was considered in Sections 1.2 and 2.4.  Here is a similar calculation for the Airy functions Ai and Bi, modeled after the page on "Airy functions" at WolframMathWorld.  (The reason for the "real" command is a bug in Matlab: Matlab's "airy" command gives spurious nonzero imaginary parts, at the level of rounding errors, when applied to some real arguments, such as x=-2.)</p><pre class="codeinput">  Ai = chebfun(<span class="string">'real(airy(0,x))'</span>,[-10,3]);

</pre><p>Chebfun finds roots by a method due to Boyd and Battles [Boyd 2002, Battles 2006].  If the chebfun is of degree greater than 100, it is broken into smaller pieces recursively.  On each small piece zeros are then found as eigenvalues of a "colleague matrix", the analogue for Chebyshev polynomials of a companion matrix for monomials [Specht 1960, Good 1961]. This method can be startlingly fast and accurate.  For example, here is a sine function with 11 zeros:</p><pre class="codeinput">  f = chebfun(<span class="string">'sin(pi*x)'</span>,[0 10]);
  lengthf = length(f)
  tic, r = roots(f); toc

If there are several funs, then roots are included at jumps as necessary.  The following example shows a chebfun with 26 pieces.  It has nine zeros: one within a fun, eight at jumps between funs.</p><pre class="codeinput">  x = chebfun(<span class="string">'x'</span>,[-2 2]);

For example, the "abs" command introduces breakpoints wherever the argument goes through zero.  Here we see that x consists of a single piece, whereas abs(x) consists of two pieces.</p><pre class="codeinput">  x = chebfun(<span class="string">'x'</span>)

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="guide3_06.png" alt=""> <p>The function "sign" also introduces breaks, as illustrated in the last section. The commands "round", "floor", and "ceil" behave like this too. For example, here is exp(x) rounded to nearest multiples of 0.5:</p><pre class="codeinput">  g = exp(x);

For example, here is a variant of the Airy function again, with all its extrema in its range of definition located and plotted.</p><pre class="codeinput">  f = chebfun(<span class="string">'exp(real(airy(x)))'</span>,[-15,0]);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="guide3_08.png" alt=""> <p>This method will find non-smooth extrema as well as smooth ones, since these correspond to "zeros" of the derivative where the derivative jumps from one sign to the other.  Here is an example.</p><pre class="codeinput">  x = chebfun(<span class="string">'x'</span>);
  f = exp(x).*sin(30*x);
  g = 2-6*x.^2;
  h = max(f,g);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="guide3_10.png" alt=""> <p>Suppose we want to pick out the local extrema that are actually local minima.  We can do that by checking for the second derivative to be positive:</p><pre class="codeinput">  h2 = diff(h,2);

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="guide3_11.png" alt=""> <h2>3.4 Global extrema: max and min<a name="18"></a></h2><p>If "min" or "max" is applied to a single chebfun, it returns its global minimum or maximum.  For example:</p><pre class="codeinput">  f = chebfun(<span class="string">'1-x.^2/2'</span>);
  [min(f) max(f)]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">ans =
   0.500000000000000   1.000000000000000
</pre><p>Chebfun computes such a result by checking the values of f at all endpoints and at zeros of the derivative.</p><p>As with standard Matlab, one can find the location of the extreme point by supplying two output arguments:</p><pre class="codeinput">  [minval,minpos] = min(f)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">minval =
   0.500000000000000

</pre><h2>3.5 norm(f,1) and norm(f,inf)<a name="26"></a></h2><p>The default, 2-norm form of the "norm" command was considered in Section 2.2. In standard Matlab one can also compute 1-, infinity-, and Frobenius norms with norm(f,1), norm(f,inf), and norm(f,'fro').  These have been overloaded in Chebfun, and in the first two cases, rootfinding is part of the implementation.  (The 2- and Frobenius norms are equal for a single chebfun but differ for quasimatrices; see Chapter 6.) The 1-norm norm(f,1) is the integral of the absolute value, and Chebfun computes this by adding up segments between zeros, at which abs(f) will typically have a discontinuous slope. The infinity-norm is computed from the formula norm(f,inf) = max(max(f),-min(f));</p><p>For example:</p><pre class="codeinput">  f = chebfun(<span class="string">'sin(x)'</span>,[103 103+4*pi]);

</pre><h2>3.6 Roots in the complex plane<a name="28"></a></h2><p>Chebfuns live on real intervals, and the funs from which they are made live on real subintervals.  But a polynomial representing a fun may have roots outside the interval of definition, which may be complex.  Sometimes we may want to get our hands on these roots, and the "roots" command makes this possible in various ways through the flags 'all', 'complex', and 'norecurse'.</p><p>The simplest example is a chebfun that is truly intended to correspond to a polynomial.  For example, the chebfun</p><pre class="codeinput">f = 1+16*x.^2;

%% CHEBFUN GUIDE 3: ROOTFINDING AND MINIMA AND MAXIMA
% Lloyd N. Trefethen, October 2009, revised February 2011

%% 3.1 roots
% Chebfun comes with a global rootfinding capability REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH the
% ability to find all the zeros of a function in its region
% of definition.  For example, here is a polynomial with two
% roots in [-1,1]:

  x = chebfun('x');
  p = x.^3 + x.^2 - x;
  r = roots(p)

%%
% We can plot p and its roots like this:
  plot(p)
  hold on, plot(r,p(r),'.r')

%%
% Of course one does not need Chebfun to find roots of a polynomial:
  roots([1 1 -1 0])

%%
% A more substantial example of rootfinding involving a Bessel function
% was considered in Sections 1.2 and 2.4.  Here is a similar calculation for
% the Airy functions Ai and Bi, modeled after the page on "Airy functions"
% at WolframMathWorld.  (The reason for the "real" command is a
% bug in Matlab: Matlab's "airy" command gives spurious nonzero imaginary
% parts, at the level of rounding errors, when applied to some real
% arguments, such as x=-2.)
  
  Ai = chebfun('real(airy(0,x))',[-10,3]);
  Bi = chebfun('real(airy(2,x))',[-10,3]);
  hold off, plot(Ai,'r')
  hold on, plot(Bi,'b')
  rA = roots(Ai); plot(rA,Ai(rA),'.r')
  rB = roots(Bi); plot(rB,Bi(rB),'.b')
  axis([-10 3 -.6 1.5]), grid on

%%
% Here for example are the three roots of Ai and Bi closest to 0:

  [rA(end-2:end) rB(end-2:end)]

%%
% Chebfun finds roots by a method due to Boyd and Battles
% [Boyd 2002, Battles 2006].  If the chebfun is of degree greater than 100,
% it is broken into smaller pieces recursively.  On each small piece
% zeros are then found as eigenvalues of a "colleague matrix", the analogue
% for Chebyshev polynomials of a companion matrix for monomials [Specht 1960, Good 1961].
% This method can be startlingly fast and accurate.  For example,
% here is a sine function with 11 zeros:

  f = chebfun('sin(pi*x)',[0 10]);
  lengthf = length(f)
  tic, r = roots(f); toc
  r

%%
% A similar computation with 101 zeros comes out equally well:
  f = chebfun('sin(pi*x)',[0 100]);
  lengthf = length(f)
  tic, r = roots(f); toc
  fprintf('%22.14f\n',r(end-4:end))

%%
% And here is the same on an interval with 1001 zeros.
  f = chebfun('sin(pi*x)',[0 1000]);
  lengthf = length(f)
  tic, r = roots(f); toc
  fprintf('%22.13f\n',r(end-4:end))

%%
% With the ability to find zeros, we can solve a variety of
% nonlinear problems.  For example, where do the curves
% x and cos(x) intersect?  Here is the answer.

  x = chebfun('x',[-2 2]);
  hold off, plot(x)
  f = cos(x);
  hold on, plot(f,'k')
  r = roots(f-x)
  plot(r,f(r),'or')

%%
% All of the examples above concern chebfuns consisting of
% a single fun.  If there are several funs, then roots are
% included at jumps as necessary.  The following
% example shows a chebfun with 26 pieces.  It has
% nine zeros: one within a fun, eight at jumps between funs.

  x = chebfun('x',[-2 2]);
  f = x.^3 - 3*x - 2 + sign(sin(20*x));
  hold off, plot(f), grid on
  r = roots(f);
  hold on, plot(r,0*r,'.r')

%% 3.2 min, max, abs, sign, round, floor, ceil
% Rootfinding is more central to Chebfun than
% one might at first imagine, because a number
% of commands, when applied to smooth chebfuns, must
% produce non-smooth results, and it is rootfinding that
% tells us where to put the discontinuities.
% For example, the "abs" command introduces breakpoints
% wherever the argument goes through zero.  Here we 
% see that x consists of a single piece, whereas abs(x) consists
% of two pieces.

  x = chebfun('x')
  absx = abs(x)
  subplot(1,2,1), plot(x,'.-')
  subplot(1,2,2), plot(absx,'.-')

%%
% We saw this effect already in Section 1.4.
% Another similar effect shown in that section occurs with
% min(f,g) or max(f,g).  Here, breakpoints are introduced
% at points where f-g is zero:

  f = min(x,-x/2), subplot(1,2,1), plot(f,'.-')
  g = max(.6,1-x.^2), subplot(1,2,2), plot(g,'.-'), ylim([.5,1])

%%
% The function "sign" also introduces breaks, as illustrated
% in the last section.
% The commands "round", "floor", and "ceil" behave like this too.
% For example, here is exp(x) rounded to nearest multiples of 0.5:

  g = exp(x);
  clf, plot(g)
  gh = 0.5*round(2*g);
  hold on, plot(gh,'r');
  grid on

%% 3.3 Local extrema: roots(diff(f))
% Local extrema of smooth functions can be located by finding
% zeros of the derivative.  For example, here is a variant of
% the Airy function again, with all its extrema in its range of
% definition located and plotted.
  f = chebfun('exp(real(airy(x)))',[-15,0]);
  clf, plot(f)
  r = roots(diff(f));
  hold on, plot(r,f(r),'.r'), grid on

%%
% This method will find non-smooth extrema as well as smooth ones,
% since these correspond to "zeros" of the derivative where
% the derivative jumps from one sign to the other.  Here is an
% example.
  x = chebfun('x');
  f = exp(x).*sin(30*x);
  g = 2-6*x.^2;
  h = max(f,g);
  clf, plot(h)

%%
% Here are all the local extrema, smooth and nonsmooth:
  extrema = roots(diff(h));
  hold on, plot(extrema,h(extrema),'.r')

%%
% Suppose we want to pick out the local extrema that are actually
% local minima.  We can do that by checking for the second
% derivative to be positive:

  h2 = diff(h,2);
  maxima = extrema(h2(extrema)>0);
  plot(maxima,h(maxima),'ok','markersize',12)

%% 3.4 Global extrema: max and min
% If "min" or "max" is applied to a single chebfun, it returns
% its global minimum or maximum.  For example:
  f = chebfun('1-x.^2/2');
  [min(f) max(f)]

%%
% Chebfun computes such a result by checking the values of
% f at all endpoints and at zeros of the derivative.

%%
% As with standard Matlab, one can find the location of the
% extreme point by supplying two output arguments:

  [minval,minpos] = min(f)
%%
% Note that just one position is returned even though the
% minimum is attained at two points.  This is consistent
% with the behavior of standard Matlab.

%%
% This ability to do global 1D optimization in Chebfun
% is rather remarkable.  Here is a nontrivial example.
  f = chebfun('sin(x)+sin(x.^2)',[0,15]);
  hold off, plot(f,'k')
%%
% The length of this chebfun is not as great as one might
% imagine:
  length(f)
%%
% Here are its global minimum and maximum:
  [minval,minpos] = min(f)
  [maxval,maxpos] = max(f)
  hold on
  plot(minpos,minval,'.b','markersize',30)
  plot(maxpos,maxval,'.r','markersize',30)

%%
% For larger chebfuns, it is inefficient to compute
% the global minimum and maximum separately like this REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH each
% one must compute the derivative and find all its zeros.
% An alternative code is offered that computes both at once:
  [extemevalues,extremepositions] = minandmax(f)

%% 3.5 norm(f,1) and norm(f,inf)
% The default, 2-norm form of the "norm" command was considered in Section 2.2.
% In standard Matlab one can also compute 1-, infinity-, and Frobenius norms
% with norm(f,1), norm(f,inf), and norm(f,'fro').  These
% have been overloaded in Chebfun, and in the first two cases, rootfinding
% is part of the implementation.  (The 2- and Frobenius norms are
% equal for a single chebfun but differ for quasimatrices; see Chapter 6.)
% The 1-norm norm(f,1) is the integral of 
% the absolute value, and Chebfun computes this by adding up segments
% between zeros, at which abs(f) will typically have a discontinuous slope.
% The infinity-norm is computed from the formula
% norm(f,inf) = max(max(f),-min(f));

%%
% For example:
  f = chebfun('sin(x)',[103 103+4*pi]);
  norm(f,inf)
  norm(f,1)

%% 3.6 Roots in the complex plane
% Chebfuns live on real intervals, and the funs from which
% they are made live on real subintervals.  But a polynomial
% representing a fun may have roots outside the interval of definition,
% which may be complex.  Sometimes we may want to get our hands on these
% roots, and the "roots" command makes this possible in various
% ways through the flags 'all', 'complex', and 'norecurse'.

%%
% The simplest example is a chebfun that is truly intended to
% correspond to a polynomial.  For example, the chebfun
f = 1+16*x.^2;

%%
% has no roots in [-1,1]:
roots(f)

%%
% We can extract its complex roots with the command
roots(f,'all')

%%
% The situation for more general chebfuns is more complicated.  For example,
% the chebfun
g = exp(x).*f(x);

%% 
% also has no roots in [-1,1],
roots(g)

%%
% but it has plenty of roots in the complex plane:
roots(g,'all')

%%
% Most of these are spurious.
% What has happened is that g is represented by a polynomial chosen
% for its approximation properties on [-1,1].
% Inevitably that polynomial will have roots
% in the complex plane, even if they have little to do with g.

%%
% One cannot expect Chebfun to solve this problem perfectly REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH after all,
% it is working on a real interval, not in the complex plane, and analytic continuation 
% from the one to the other is
% well known to be an ill-posed problem.  Nevertheless, Chebfun may do a pretty good job of
% selecting genuine complex (and real)
% roots near the interval of definition if you use the 'complex' flag:
roots(g,'complex')

%%
% We will not go into detail here of how this is done, but the idea is that associated
% with any fun is a family of "Chebfun ellipses" in the complex plane, with foci at
% the endpoints, inside which
% one may expect reasonably good accuracy of the fun.  Assuming the interval is
% [-1,1] and the fun has length L, the Chebfun ellipse associated with a parameter
% delta<<1 is the region in the complex plane bounded by the image under the map
% (z+1/z)/2 of the circle |z|=r, where r is defined by r^(-L)=delta.  The
% command roots(g,'complex') first effectively does roots(g,'all'), then returns only
% those roots lying inside a particular Chebfun ellipse REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH we take the one corresponding
% to delta equal to the square root of the Chebfun tolerance parameter eps.

%%
% One must expect complex roots of chebfuns to lose accuracy as one moves away from
% the interval of definition.  Here's an example:
f = exp(exp(x)).*(x-0.1i).*(x-.3i).*(x-.6i).*(x-1i);
roots(f,'complex')
%%
% Notice that the first three imaginary roots are located with
% about 10, 8, and 6 digits of accuracy, while the fourth does not appear
% in the list at all.

%%
% Here is a more complicated example:
F = @(x) 4+sin(x)+sin(sqrt(2)*x)+sin(pi*x);
f = chebfun(F,[-100,100]);

%%
% This function has a lot of complex roots lying in strips on either side
% of the real axis.
r = roots(f,'complex');
hold off, plot(r,'.','markersize',6)

%%
% If you are dealing with complex roots of complicated chebfuns like this,
% it may be safer to add a flag 'nonrecurse' to the roots call, at the
% cost of slowing down the computation.
% This turns off the Boyd-Battles recursion mentioned
% above, lowering the chance of missing a few roots near interfaces of the
% recursion.  If we try that here we find that the results look almost the
% same as before in a plot:
r2 = roots(f,'complex','norecurse');
hold on, plot(r,'om','markersize',8)

%%
% However, the accuracy has improved:
norm(F(r))
norm(F(r2))

%%
% To find poles in the complex plane as opposed to zeros, see Section 4.8.
