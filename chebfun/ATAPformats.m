% Nick Trefethen, May 2009: This code sets certain default properties and
% is called at the beginning of each section of the book so that the output
% from "publish" has a pleasing appearance.  It is included in this
% directory as part of the Chebfun distribution so that readers of the book
% need only download Chebfun to be able to execute each section.
