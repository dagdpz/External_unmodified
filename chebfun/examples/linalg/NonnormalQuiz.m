%% Nonnormality quiz from Trefethen and Embree

%%
% The frontispiece of the book Spectra and Pseudospctra presents a quiz
% involving two matrices:
A1 = [-1 1; 0 -1],  A2 = [-1 5; 0 -2]

%%
% The quiz is about the behavior of solutions to the differential equation
% u' = Au, where A is one of these matrices. The solution of this equation
% is u(t) = exp(tA)u(0), where exp(tA) is the exponential of the matrix tA,
% computed in Matlab by the command EXPM.  The maximum possible value of
% the quotient norm(u(t))/norm(u(0)) is equal to the matrix norm of
% expm(tA).

%%
% 
% We first present the plot, then explain what it means and
% how we computed it with Chebfun.
e1 = chebfun(@(t) norm(expm(t*A1)),[0 3.4],'vectorize');
e2 = chebfun(@(t) norm(expm(t*A2)),[0 3.4],'vectorize');
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize';
hold off, plot(e1,'b',LW,2)
hold on,  plot(e2,'r',LW,2)
ylim([0 1.5]), grid on, legend('A1','A2')
xlabel('t',FS,14)
ylabel('||e^{tA}||',FS,14)
title('Which curve is which?',FS,16)

%%
% The plot shows two curves, one with a hump and one without. The book asks,
% "Which curve is which?", and doesn't reveal the answer, but here you can
% see that A2 is the matrix with the hump.  This is surprising to some
% people, for one might expect the hump to correspond to A1 since it is
% nondiagonalizable.  In fact, the nondiagonalizability of A1 is less
% important than the large entry 5 in the upper-right corner of A2.

%%
% This is a natural problem for Chebfun because Chebfun is good at
% working with functions that don't have a representation by
% an explicit formula.  Here the function we are concerned with is
% norm(expm(tA)), a function of time t.  Chebfun is happy to sample
% that function at various values of t and construct a corresponding
% chebfun.  Since norm(expm(tA)) will not work when t is a vector,
% the 'vectorize' flag is included to avoid a warning message.
