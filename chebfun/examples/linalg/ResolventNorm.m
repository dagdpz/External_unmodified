% If A is a square matrix, the resolvent of A for a particular complex
% number z is the matrix inv(z*I-A).  The 2-norm of the resolvent is a
% quantity of interest in many applications.  For example, if
% norm(inv(zI-A)) = 1/eps for some quantity eps, then there is a matrix E
% with norm norm(E)=eps such that z is an eigenvalue of A+E.  This is
% the starting point of the theory of pseudospectra [1].

%%
% In particular, suppose all the eigenvalues of A are in the left half
% of the complex plane, so that A is stable in the sense that all
% solutions of the differential equation du/dt = Au decay to zero
% as t -> infinity.  How small a perturbation matrix
% E might make A unstable?
% The answer is norm(E)=eps, where 1/eps is the maximum of
% norm(inv(zI-A)) as z ranges over the imaginary axis.  Therefore
% in a number of fields such as control theory, there is special 
% interest in the values taken by the norm of the resolvent on
% the imaginary axis.

%%
% Let's compute this function with Chebfun.  As an example we take the
% matrix
A = [-1 3 5 2; -3 -2 4 6; -5 -4 -2 1; -2 -6 -1 3]

%%
% A has two pairs of eigenvalues near the imaginary axis:
format short, eig(A)

%%
% Suppose z=x+iy.  It takes Chebfun a fraction of a second to compute
% a chebfun representating norm(inv(zI-A)) as a function of y, with
% x=0.  Here is that calculation and a plot of the result:
I = eye(size(A));
nr = @(y) 1/min(svd(1i*y*I-A));
f = chebfun(nr,[-25,25],'vectorize');
LW = 'linewidth';
plot(f,LW,1.6), grid on

%%
% The maximum of f is this,
maxf = max(f)

%%
% and the distance to instability is
% the reciprocal of this quantity,
dist_sing = 1/maxf

%%
% Let us consider another example matrix, and this time, let's
% make an anonymous function to construct the chebfun.
normfun = @(A) chebfun(@(y) 1/min(svd(1i*y*eye(size(A))-A)),...
   1.5*norm(A)*[-1,1],'vectorize');

%%
% Here is a 5x5 which we take to be complex, to break
% the symmetry:
B =  [ -3-2i   1+1i    -1i      0   -1+1i
           0  -2-3i    -1i     1i   -2-1i
          1i      0  -2-4i  -2-1i    2-1i
           0      1     1i  -2-4i      1i
        1-2i      0      1      1   -2-3i ];    
eig(B)
%%
% And here is its resolvent norm plot:
fB = normfun(B);
plot(fB,LW,1.6), grid on
title(['maximum = ' num2str(max(fB))]);

%%
% Here are 12 random 6x6 complex matrices, all with rightmost eigenvalue
% having real part -0.25:
randn('seed',1)
for j = 1:12
    N = 6;
    A = randn(N) + 1i*randn(N) + 2i*diag(randn(N,1));
    abscissa = max(real(eig(A)));
    A = A - (abscissa+0.25)*eye(N);
    subplot(4,3,j)
    plot(normfun(A),LW,1)
    axis([-10 10 0 8]), drawnow
end
