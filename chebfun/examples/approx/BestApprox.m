% Chebfun's REMEZ command, written by Ricardo Pachon, can compute best
% (i.e. infinity-norm or minimax) approximations  of a real function on a
% real interval. For example, here is an absolute value function on [-1,1]
% and its best approximation by a polynomial of degree 10:

x = chebfun('x');
f = abs(x-0.5);
[p,err] = remez(f,10);
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 14;
figure, plot(f,'b',p,'r',LW,1.6)
title('Function and best polynomial approximation',FS,fs)

%%
% Here is the error curve, with 12 points of equioscillation:
figure, plot(f-p,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-1 1],err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-1 1],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim([-.05 .05])
title('Degree 10 polynomial error curve',FS,fs)

%%
% In Chebfun Version 3, REMEZ could only compute polynomial approximations,
% but Version 4 introduced some capabilities with rational approximations
% too.  For example, here is the error curve for type (5,5) best rational
% approximation of the same function f, plotted on the same scale.  Note
% that there are again 12 points of equioscillation, but this time, they
% are more closely clustered near the singularity.
[p,q,rh,err] = remez(f,5,5);
hold off, plot(f-p./q,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-1 1],err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-1 1],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim([-.05 .05])
title('Type (5,5) rational error curve',FS,fs)

% For rational approximation, Chebfun's REMEZ command is currently not very
% robust.  An often better alternative is CF approximation; see the CF
% command.
