%%
% The example approx/OrthPolys [2] discusses orthogonal polynomials, defined
% by the condition
%
%      b
%      /
%      | w(x) P_j(x) P_k(x) dx = < P_j, P_k > = 0 for all j not equal k
%      /
%     a
%
% As mentioned there, Chebfun has commands LEGPOLY, CHEBPOLY, LAGPOLY,
% HERMPOLY for computing some standard cases.

%%
% Here, instead of Gram-Schmidt, we construct some of these polynomials
% via a three-term recurrence relation
%
%    gamma(k+1)*P_k+1(x) = (x - beta(k))*P_k(x) - gamma(k)*P_k-1(x)
%
% where the coefficients gamma(k) and beta(k) are either known in
% advance or computed from
%
%    gamma(k) = < x*P_k-1 , P_k >,  beta(k) = < x*P_k , P_k >.

%%
% Given any positive weight function w(x), we can construct both the
% polynomials P_k(x) and the recurrence coefficients beta(k) and gamma(k)
% using the Lanczos algorithm [1].

%%
% Whereas the Gram-Schmidt process requires O(n^2)
% evaluations of the inner product to compute the n first polynomials,
% the Lanczos process requires only two such evaluations per
% polynomial. Furthermore, the three-term recurrence coefficients
% can be used to construct a Gaussian quadrature rule for the given
% weight function w(x).

%% 
% We start by initializing the parameters of this set of polynomials, e.g.
% the variable x in the interval [-1,1], the weight function in that same
% interval as well as the highest-degree polynomial we wish to construct.

x = chebfun( 'x' , [-1,1] );
w = exp(pi*x);
N = 5;

%%
% We then initialize the recursion by constructing the first two polynomials
% and their recurrence coefficients explicitly.
P = chebfun( 1./sqrt(sum(w)) , domain(x) );
v = x.*P;
beta(1) = sum(w.*v.*P);
v = v - beta(1)*P;
gamma(1) = sqrt(sum( w.*v.^2 ));
P(:,2) = v / gamma(1);

%%
% The remaining polynomials and coefficients can be computed iteratively
% using the Lanczos process.

for k=2:N
    v = x.*P(:,k) - gamma(k-1)*P(:,k-1);
    beta(k) = sum(w.*v.*P(:,k));
    v = v - beta(k)*P(:,k);
    gamma(k) = sqrt(sum( w.*v.^2 ));
    P(:,k+1) = v / gamma(k);
end

%%
% We can now plot these polynomials
figure
plot(P)
title('Orthogonal polynomials on [-1,1] wrt w = exp(pi*x)');

%%
% and verify that they are indeed orthogonal with respect to w.
W = repmat(w,1,N+1);
I = P'*(W.*P);
err = norm(I-eye(N+1))

%%
% Since, along with the polynomials, we have also computed the coefficients
% beta and gamma of the three-term recurrence relation, we can also construct
% Gaussian quadrature rules with respect to the weight function w using the
% Golub-Welsch algorithm [3]. For N points, this is

J = diag(beta) + diag(gamma(1:N-1),-1) + diag(gamma(1:N-1),+1)
[V,D] = eig( J );
xi = diag( D );
wk = (2*V(1,:).^2)';
[ xi , wk ]

%%
% We can verify that the nodes are indeed the roots of the Nth orthogonal
% polynomial:
norm( xi - roots(P(:,N+1)) )
