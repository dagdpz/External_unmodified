%% Lebesgue functions and Lebesgue constants

%%
% Lebesgue constants are a standard notion of approximation theory.
% Suppose we have n+1 points xj in an interval [a,b] with associated data
% values fj with abs(fj)<=1, and we interpolate this data by a polynomial
% p(x) of degree n. What's the maximum possible value of abs(p(x)) at each
% point x? This function of x is called the Lebesgue function for the given
% grid.  The Lebesgue constant is the the maximum of L(x) over the
% interval. Equivalently, it is the infinity-norm of the linear operator
% mapping data to interpolant on the given grid and interval.

%%
% Chebfun has a command LEBESGUE for working with these notions.
% For example, here are the Lebesgue functions and
% constants for 10 Chebyshev points and 10 equispaced points in [-1,1]:
FS = 'fontsize'; LW = 'linewidth';
[Lfun,Lambda] = lebesgue(chebpts(10));
subplot(2,1,1), plot(Lfun,LW,1.6), grid on
title(sprintf('10 Chebyshev points    Lambda = %3.2f',Lambda),FS,14)
[Lfun,Lambda] = lebesgue(linspace(-1,1,10));
subplot(2,1,2), plot(Lfun,LW,1.6), grid on
title(sprintf('10 equispaced points    Lambda = %4.2f',Lambda),FS,14)

%%
% If we increase 10 to 40, we need to switch to a semilogy plot
% to see the results:
[Lfun,Lambda] = lebesgue(chebpts(40));
subplot(2,1,1), semilogy(Lfun,LW,1.6), grid on
title(sprintf('40 Chebyshev points    Lambda = %3.2f',Lambda),FS,14)
[Lfun,Lambda] = lebesgue(linspace(-1,1,40));
subplot(2,1,2), semilogy(Lfun,LW,1.6), grid on
title(sprintf('40 equispaced points    Lambda = %5.2e',Lambda),FS,14)

%%
% This picture confirms the well-known fact (the Runge phenomenon) that
% polynomial interpolation in equispaced points is terribly
% ill-conditioned.  In fact it is known that as n increases to infinity,
% the Lebesgue constant for n Chebyshev points is asymptotic to
% (2/pi)log(n) whereas for n equispaced points it is 2^n/(e n log(n)).

%%
% Here are results for 10 and 30 random points in [-1,1].  The reason for
% shrinking the number from 40 to 30 is that for larger values than this,
% difficulties arise caused by rounding errors since the Lebesgue function
% is bigger than the inverse of machine epsilon.
rand('seed',1)
[Lfun,Lambda] = lebesgue(2*rand(10,1)-1);
subplot(2,1,1), semilogy(Lfun,LW,1.6), grid on
title(sprintf('10 random points    Lambda = %5.2e',Lambda),FS,14)
[Lfun,Lambda] = lebesgue(2*rand(30,1)-1);
subplot(2,1,2), semilogy(Lfun,LW,1.6), grid on
title(sprintf('30 random points    Lambda = %5.2e',Lambda),FS,14)
