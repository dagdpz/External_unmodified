%% A greedy algorithm for choosing interpolation points

%%
% In the theory of polynomial interpolation, an important issue is the
% distribution of the interpolation points.  Points that cluster near the
% boundary, such as Chebyshev points, are usually much better than
% equispaced points.

%%
% Suppose we don't know any of the theory and just let an algorithm pick
% effective points on the fly.  Specifically, suppose f is a continuous
% function on [-1,1]. We could take the first interpolation point x0 to be
% a point where f achieves its maximum absolute value and compute the
% corresponding interpolant p0 of degree 0.  Then we could take the second
% interpolation point x1 to be a point where f-p0 achieves its maximum
% absolute value. And so on.

%%
% Using Chebfun's interp1 command, it is easy to try out this idea. An
% interesting choice for f is the absolute value:
x = chebfun('x');
f = abs(x);

%%
% Here is a loop to compute the first few polynomial interpolants and plot
% their errors:
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
s = []; [maxval, maxpos] = norm(f,inf);
for n = 0:4
   s = [s; maxpos];
   p = interp1(s,f);
   err = f-p;
   [maxval, maxpos] = norm(err,inf);
   hold off, plot(err,LW,2), ylim(1.2*maxval*[-1 1]), grid on
   hold on, plot(maxpos,err(maxpos),'.r','markersize',24)
   title(['n = ' int2str(n)  '    error = ' num2str(maxval)],FS,16), snapnow
end

%%
% Let's continue to n = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128:
for n = 5:128
   s = [s; maxpos];
   p = interp1(s,f);
   err = f-p;
   [maxval, maxpos] = norm(err,inf);
   if log2(n)==round(log2(n))
     hold off, plot(err,LW,2), ylim(1.2*maxval*[-1 1]), grid on
     hold on, plot(maxpos,err(maxpos),'.r','markersize',24)
     title(['n = ' int2str(n)  '    error = ' num2str(maxval)],FS,16), snapnow
   end
end

%%
% The greedy algorithm has chosen interpolation points that cluster near
% the boundary.  Here they are in black, compared with Chebyshev points in red:
hold off, plot(sort(s),'.k',MS,12)
scheb = chebpts(length(s));
hold on, plot(scheb,'or',MS,6)
ylim(1.02*[-1 1])

%%
% Here is a comparison of the Lebesgue function of the greedy
% points, again compared with Chebyshev points in red:
hold off, semilogy(lebesgue(s),'k',LW,1.4)
hold on, semilogy(lebesgue(scheb),'r',LW,1.4)

%%
% The flavor of this kind of algorithm is reminiscent of the
% theory of Leja points [1], though the details are different since
% Leja points are determined just by the domain of approximation whereas
% here we are adaptively working with the function f itself.
% For an explanation related to
% potential theory of why effective interpolation grids tend to cluster
% near boundaries, see Chapter 12 of [2].
