% Peter Lax mentioned to me recently an example that no doubt various
% people have thought about over the years.  Suppose we think of x^2 as
% a given number and we try to find its square root by solving the
% equation
%
%   r^2 = x^2
%
% for r using Newton's method beginning from the guess r=1.
% The successive iterates are given by the formula
%
%   r := (r^2+x^2)/2r .
%
% After k steps we have a rational function of type (2^k,2^k), and
% these functions will approach the function abs(x).

%%
% Let's see the iteration in action:
x = chebfun('x');
r = chebfun('1');
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.6; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 12;
for k = 0:5
    subplot(3,2,k+1)
    plot(r,LW,lw), axis([-1 1 -.2 1.2]), grid on
    err = norm(r-abs(x),inf);
    s = sprintf('error=%4.1e   len=%d',err,length(r));
    title(s,FS,fs)
    r = (r.^2+x.^2)./(2*r);
end

%%
% The curves look nice, but the exponentially growing chebfun lengths do not.
% To improve this, we can put a breakpoint at x=0:
x = chebfun('x',[-1 0 1]);
r = chebfun('1',[-1 0 1]);
for k = 0:5
    subplot(3,2,k+1)
    plot(r,LW,lw), axis([-1 1 -.2 1.2]), grid on
    err = norm(r-abs(x),inf);
    s = sprintf('error=%4.1e   length = %d',err,length(r));
    title(s,FS,fs)
    r = (r.^2+x.^2)./(2*r);
end

%%
% It's interesting to look at the error.  In the outer half
% of the interval, we've already achieved machine precision, whereas
% near x=0 the errors remain large.
clf, semilogy(abs(r-abs(x)),LW,lw)
axis([-1 1 1e-18 10]), grid on
xlabel('x',FS,fs)
title('Error',FS,fs)

%%
% Let's take six more steps of the iteration:
for k = 0:5
    subplot(3,2,k+1)
    plot(r,LW,lw), axis([-1 1 -.2 1.2]), grid on
    err = norm(r-abs(x),inf);
    s = sprintf('error=%4.1e   length = %d',err,length(r));
    title(s,FS,fs)
    r = (r.^2+x.^2)./(2*r);
end

%%
% Here is the error:
clf, semilogy(abs(r-abs(x)),LW,lw)
axis([-1 1 1e-18 10]), grid on
xlabel('x',FS,fs)
title('Error',FS,fs)

%%
% Evidently we are getting convergence to abs(x), for all x.
% In the infinity norm, the rate looks pretty disappointing.
% Donald Newman showed that the optimal type (n,n)
% rational approximants to abs(x) achieve accuracy O(exp(-C*sqrt(n)))
% [1,2], whereas here the maximum error is exactly 2^(-k) after k steps,
% which corresponds to 1/n for the type (n,n) approximation.  
% Away from x=0, however, the accuracy is O(exp(-C*n)), thanks to the quadratic
% convergence of Newton's method.

%%
% Incidentally, note that this last curve is not very close to symmetrical
% about x=0.  I wonder why not?
