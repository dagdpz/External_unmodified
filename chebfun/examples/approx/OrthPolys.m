% Orthogonal polynomials are, as the name might suggest, polynomials which
% are orthogonal to each other in some weighted L^2 inner product, i.e., 
%
%      b
%      /
%      | w(x) P_j(x) P_k(x) dx = < P_j, P_k > = 0 for all j not equal k
%      /
%     a

%%
% If we normalise so that < P_j, P_j > = 1, the polynomials are called
% "orthonormal".

%%
% Chebfun has commands built-in for some of the standard orthogonal
% polynomials. Below is a table of the polynomial, the weight function, the 
% standard domain [a b], and the Chebfun routine name.
%
%      Name       |       w(x)     |   domain   | Chebfun routine
% -------------------------------------------------------------------
%     Legendre    |        1       |   [-1 1]   | LEGPOLY(N)
% Chebyshev(1st) |  1/sqrt(1-x^2) |   [-1 1]   | CHEBPOLY(N)
% Chebyshev(2nd) |   sqrt(1-x^2)  |   [-1 1]   | CHEBPOLY(N,2)
%     Laguerre    |     exp(-x)    |   [0 inf]  | LAGPOLY(N)
%     Hermite     |    exp(-x^2)   | [-inf inf] | HERMPOLY(N)

%%
% For each of the examples above there are readily computed recurrence
% relations which allow fast computation of the polynomials, and Chebfun
% exploits these. However, sometimes we wish to construct orthogonal
% polynomials with non-standard weight functions, and orthogonalisation 
% via the Gram-Schmidt process is one method of doing so.

%%
% The process (sometimes referred to as the "Stieltjes process")
% iteratively constructs the next degree polynomial by removing the
% components in the directions of the previous ones. This can be
% expressed as
%
%         P_{k+1} = x^{k+1} - SUM(< x^{k+1},P_j >/< P_j,P_j > * P_j).
%%
% In practice one usually replaces x^{k+1} by x*P_k or the k+1th Chebyshev
% polynomial to improve stability.

%%
% The short code below demonstrates these ideas by computing the first 5
% orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight function w = exp(pi*x).

x = chebfun('x',[-1 1]);
w = exp(pi*x);
N = 5;
P = OrthPoly(w,N);

    function P = OrthPoly(w,N)
        if isnumeric(w), w = chebfun(w,[-1 1]); end
        d = w.ends;           % The domain
        x = chebfun('x',d);   % Linear chebfun
        P(:,1) = chebfun(1./sqrt(sum(w)),d); % The constant (normalised)
        for k = 1:N;
%             xk = x.^k;
            xk = x.*P(:,k);
            P(:,k+1) = xk;
            for j = 1:k       % Subtract out the components
                C = sum(w.*xk.*P(:,j));
                P(:,k+1) = P(:,k+1) - C*P(:,j);
            end
            P(:,k+1) = P(:,k+1)./sqrt(sum(w.*P(:,k+1).^2)); % normalise
        end
    end

% and confirm that they are orthogonal
W = repmat(w,1,N+1);
I = P'*(W.*P);
err = norm(I-eye(N+1))

%%
% One useful application of orthogonal polynomials is to find best
% polynomial approximations in the norm associated with the L^2
% inner-product space associated with w(x), with 
%
%    P*_n = SUM( < f, P_j >*P_j ).
%%
% Here we do this with w as above and approximate f(x) = abs(x);

f = abs(x);
alpha = zeros(N+1,1);
for k = 0:N
    alpha(k+1) = sum(w.*P(:,k+1).*f);
end
P_star = P*alpha;

% Notice how the approximation is better for larger x, as w(x) = exp(pi*x)
% gives more weight to the error introduced there.
