%% Parameter-dependent ODEs: Three examples
% Alex Townsend, August 2011

%%
% (Chebfun example ode/ParamODEs.m)

%%
% There are many examples of parameter-dependent ODEs such as simple
% harmonic motion and Lotka-Volterra equations. If a parameter is unknown
% then the problem can be recast as a system. However, Chebfun also allows
% the user to input the parameter-dependent ODE without explicitly
% rewriting the ODE as a system. Below are three such examples.

%% 1. Toy Example
% Let's take the parameter-dependent ODE given by,
%%
% 0.001u'' + xu + a =0, u(-1)=-a-1, u'(-1)=0, u(1)=1. 

%%
% The extra condition is required in order to solve for the unknown
% parameter. Here is how to solve it in Chebfun without recasting as a
% system.

LW = 'LineWidth'; FS = 'FontSize';
N = chebop(@(x,u,a) 0.001*diff(u,2) + x.*u + a);
N.lbc = @(u,a) [u + a + 1, diff(u)];
N.rbc = @(u,a) u - 1;
ua = N\0
plot(ua,LW,2); title('Solution to parameter-dependent ODE',FS,16);
legend('u','a');
a = ua(1,2)

%% 2. Newton's Law of Cooling
% During the Jack the Ripper murder investigations in the 1880s, detectives
% estimated the time of death of a victim by using body temperature. Upon
% finding the victim, body temperature was measured. If the body was warm
% then the murder had only just occurred. If the body was cold then it
% happened many hours before. To make this more precise, take Newton's Law
% of cooling which is

%%
% y' + k(y-S)=0, y(0)=y0

%%
% where y is the temperature of the body, S is ambient temperature, and k a
% cooling parameter. Suppose that the body was murdered at t=0 at a
% temperature of 37 celsius and found at t=T at a temperature of 20
% celsius. Find the time of death?

k = 1e-3; % Cooling parameter
S = 15;   % Ambient temperature
t0 = 37;  % Initial temperature
tT = 20;  % Discovery temperature
% Rescale the equation by x=t/T to form parameter-dependent ODE.
N = chebop(@(x,y,T) diff(y) + k.*T.*(y-S),[0 1]);
N.lbc = @(y,T) y-t0;
N.rbc = @(y,T) y-tT;
% Solve
yT = N\0;
% Rescale solution and plot
T = yT(1,2); t = chebfun(@(t) t/T,[0 T]); y = yT(t,1); 
plot(y,LW,2), title('Temperature of body Vs. Time',FS,16);
xlabel('Time in seconds',FS,10), ylabel('Temperature',FS,10);
fprintf('T is estimated to be %1.2f hrs.\n',yT(1,2)/360)

%%
% From the estimate of T we are able to calculate the time of the murder
% given the time the body was found. The detectives in the 19th century
% didn't always get the time of the murder correct.

%% 3. Lane-Emden Equation from Astrophysics
% The Lane-Emden equation from Astrophysics is 
%%
% x*u'' + 2*u' + x*u^n = 0, u'(0)=0, u(0)=1.

%%
% The first root of the solution is important and since this is unknown it
% can be introduced by scaling the independent parameter-dependent ODE. The
% unknown parameter is then the first root of the solution [2]. The
% equation has a weak singularity at the right end of the interval and we
% perturb it by 1e-12 to make the problem easier to solve.

n = 4.5;
%Parameter-dependent ODE
N = chebop(@(x,u,v) x.*diff(u,2) + 2*diff(u) + x.*v.^2.*(u+1e-12).^n,[0 1]);
N.lbc = @(u,v) [u-1,diff(u)];
N.rbc = @(u,v) u;
%Choose initial condition.
x = chebfun(@(x) x,[0 1]);
N.init = [cos(pi/2*x),3];
%Solve
uv = N\0;
%Rescale solution and plot.
t = chebfun('t',[0,uv(1,2)]); u = uv(t./uv(1,2),1);
plot(u,LW,2), hold on; 
title('Solution of the Lane-Emden equation for n=4.5',FS,16),

% Let's compare the computed first root for n=4.5 to the result in [1]:

norm(uv(1,2)-31.836463244694285264)
