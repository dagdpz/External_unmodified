%% Orbiting around fixed stars

%%
% Suppose a "star" of unit mass is fixed at the origin in the
% x-y plane, and
% a planet, also of unit mass, moves around it according
% to Newton's laws with gravitational constant 1.  To be
% specific, let's suppose the planet starts at (-1,1) heading east
% with speed v=1.  What does the trajectory look like?

%%
% Here is a code to solve this problem using Chebfun's ode113 command,
% and complex arithmetic for simplicity.  We track the orbit for 23
% time units and see that it is an ellipse.
tmax = 23; d = domain([0 tmax]);
LW = 'linewidth'; MS = 'markersize';
opts = odeset('abstol',1e-10,'reltol',1e-10);
fun = @(t,u) [u(2); -u(1)./abs(u(1)).^3];
u0 = -1+1i;
v = 1;
uv = ode113(fun,d,[u0; v],opts); uv = uv(:,1);
hold off, plot(0,0,'.r','markersize',24), hold on
plot(uv,LW,1.6), axis equal, grid on, shg
plot(uv(0:tmax),'.k',MS,16)

%%
% If we want the initial speed v to be a parameter, we can make
% an anonymous function:
u = @(v) ode113(fun,d,[u0; v],opts);

%%
% Here are the orbits for v = .5, .75, 1, 1.5, 2.  This kind of
% thing is familiar from introductory physics: every orbit is an
% ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola.
hold off, plot(0,0,'.r','markersize',24), hold on
for v = [.5 .75 1 1.5 2]
     uv = u(v); uv = uv(:,1); plot(uv,LW,1.6)
     plot(uv(0:tmax),'.k',MS,16)
end
axis([-3 3 -3 3]), axis square, grid on, shg

%%
% More unusual behavior comes about if we imagine two or more fixed
% "stars".  Orbits can now be bounded without being
% periodic.  For example, suppose we have one star at (0,0) and
% another at (1,0), with the planet feeling a gravitational tug from
% each.  Here is an orbit over 10 time units starting with v=1:
fun = @(t,u) [u(2); -u(1)./abs(u(1)).^3-(u(1)-1)./abs(u(1)-1).^3];
tmax = 10; d = domain([0 tmax]);
u = @(v) ode113(fun,d,[u0; v],opts);
v = 1; uv = u(v); uv = uv(:,1);
hold off, plot([0 1],[0 0],'.r','markersize',24), hold on
plot(uv,LW,1.6), axis equal, grid on, shg
plot(uv(0:tmax),'.k',MS,16)

%%
% Here is what happens when the initial speed is reduced to 0.9:
v = 0.9; uv = u(v); uv = uv(:,1);
hold off, plot([0 1],[0 0],'.r','markersize',24), hold on
plot(uv,LW,1.6), axis equal, grid on, shg
plot(uv(0:tmax),'.k',MS,16)

%%
% How long is the trajectory?
orbit_length = norm(diff(uv),1)

%%
% How close does it come to the origin?
closeness = min(abs(uv))
