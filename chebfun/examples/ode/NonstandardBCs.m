%%
% With the advances of automatic differentiation of scalars in Chebfun it
% is now possible to solve ODEs in Chebfun with more exotic constraints
% than simply conditions at the endpoints of the domain. These include
% interior point conditions, as well as conditions on the function over the
% whole domain.
%
% This example describes how to solve problems of this kind. All the ODEs
% here are linear, but the approach extends to nonlinear problems too.
%
%% Example 1: Mean zero solution
% In this example, we solve the ODE
%
%     u'' + x.^2*u = 1
%
% on the domain [-1,1] such that
%
%     u(-1) = 1;
%     The average of u over [-1,1] is 0
%
% Equivalent way to state the second condition is that the definite
% integral of the solution over the domain must be zero.

%%
% As usual, we start by creating a chebop:
N = chebop(@(x,u) diff(u,2)+x.^2.*u);

%%
% Since the first condition is applied on the left endpoint of the domain,
% we use the .lbc field of the chebop:
N.lbc = 1;

%%
% However, the second condition applies on the function over the whole
% domain. We use the field .bc to enforce that condition
N.bc = @(x,u) sum(u);

%%
% Note that here N.bc is an anonymous function. Chebfun interprets this to
% be a condition that applies on the solution over the interior of the
% domain (compared to, e.g., N.bc = 1 or N.bc = 'dirichlet', which
% automatically get transformed into conditions on both boundaries).
% Further, note that the anonymous function can take x, the independent
% variable on the domain as an argument, allowing you to introduce
% weighting functions in problems.

%%
% We now solve the problem in the regular way using backslash and plot the
% solution:
u = N\1; plot(u)
%%
% We confirm that we've solved the problem by calculating the residual of
% the differential equation and both the conditions:
disp(['Residual of Differ. equation:   ', num2str(norm(N(u)-1))])
disp(['Residual of Left BC:            ', num2str(abs(u(-1)-1))])
disp(['Residual of Interior Condition: ', num2str(abs(sum(u)))])
%%
% We could also require the mean of u to take another value,
% e.g. 1, via
N.bc = @(x,u) mean(u)-1;

%%
% If we now solve the problem, we see that this condition is satisfied to a
% high accuracy
u = N\1;
disp(['Residual of Interior Condition: ', num2str(abs(mean(u)-1))])
%%
% Finally, we could also introduce some weighting, for example, we could
% look for a solution which is orthogonal to sin(4*pi*x):
N.bc = @(x,u) sum(sin(4*pi*x).*u);
u = N\1; plot(u)
%%
% Again, we obtained an accurate solution (to evaluate the interior point
% condition, we need to create the chebfun x):
disp(['Residual of Differ. equation:   ', num2str(norm(N(u)-1))])
disp(['Residual of Left BC:            ',  num2str(abs(u(-1)-1))])
x = chebfun('x');
disp(['Residual of Interior Condition: ', num2str(abs(sum(sin(4*pi*x).*u)))])
%% Example 2: Interior point conditions
% We now wish to solve the same ODE as above:
%
%     u'' + x.^2*u = 1
%
% on the domain [-1,1], but in addition to a left boundary condition
%
%     u(-1) = 1
%
% we now have the interior point condition
%
%     u(0) = .5;

%%
% We reuse the chebop from above, and only need to change the .bc field:
N.bc = @(x,u) u(0)-.5;
%%
% We solve the problem and confirm that we obtain an accurate solution
u = N\1; plot(u)
disp(['Residual of Differ. equation:   ', num2str(norm(N(u)-1))])
disp(['Residual of Left BC:            ', num2str(abs(u(-1)-1))])
disp(['Residual of Interior Condition: ', num2str(abs(u(0)-.5))])

%%
% If we want to impose conditions on the derivative, such as
%
%     u'(0) = 1;
%
% we need to use a little trick in order to be able to evaluate the
% derivative at an interior point. MATLAB doesn't allow the stacked
% parentheses we would need for something like @(x,u) diff(u)(0), so
% instead this is achived using the feval method:
N.bc = @(x,u) feval(diff(u),0)-1;
%%
% We solve the problem
u = N\1; plot(u)

%%
% and confirm that we obtain an accurate solution
disp(['Residual of Differ. equation:   ', num2str(norm(N(u)-1))])
disp(['Residual of Left BC:            ', num2str(abs(u(-1)-1))])
up = diff(u);
disp(['Residual of Interior Condition: ', num2str(abs(up(0)-1))])
