%% Lane-Emden equation from astrophysics

% (Chebfun example ode/LaneEmden.m)

%% 
% This example is motivated by discussions with the astronomer Alfred
% Gautschy. The equation is also a demo in chebgui (in the IVP section).

%% Introduction
% The well-known Lane-Emden equation models the mechanical structure of
% self-gravitating spheres. In astrophysics it plays an important role as
% it serves to model the structure of stars, ranging from white dwarfs to
% red giants. The equation is given by
%%
%    x*u'' + 2*u' + x*u^n = 0,   u'(0) = 0,    u(0) = 1

%%
% where u is the solution (known as a polytrope) which models the density
% of the gas cloud. The variable x corresponds to the radial distance from
% the centre.  The gas is assumed to be polytropic with index n, that is
% pressure = C*density^(1+1/n) where C is a constant.

%% Integer polytropic index
% Below we compute the polytropes for index n=0:5

%Colour matrix to make the plot pretty.
myColor = [0 0 0; 1 0 0; 1 1 0; 0 1 0; 0 0 1; 1 0 1];

%n = Characteristic exponent
for n = 0:5
    % Assign the L-E operator on that domain.
    N = chebop(@(x,u) x.*diff(u,2)+2.*diff(u)+x.*u.^n,[0,10]);

    % Left boundary conditions
    N.lbc = @(u) [u-1,diff(u)];

    %Solve the bvp
    u = solvebvp(N,0);

    % Create plot of the solutions
    plot(u,'Linewidth',2,'Color',myColor(n+1,:)), hold on, 
    axis([0 10 -1 1]),

    xlabel('x'), ylabel('u')

%% 
% Analytic solutions exist when n=0, 1 and 5. So we can check the numerical
% error in these cases. We just do n=5:

%%
% Analytic solution from [3]:
f = chebfun(@(x) (1+x.^2/3).^-.5,[0,10]);

%%
% Compute the L2 error
fprintf('The L2 error is: %1.3e\n', norm(f-u));

%% Finding the polytropic radius
% Physically, the first root of the solution is of interest as it defines
% the outer boundary of the sphere where the gas cloud is polytropic. Since
% the magnitude of the radius is not known a priori, it can be introduced
% as an unknown function v; the independent variable can then be
% transformed as x -> x/v.  We then use a perturbation trick by a small
% factor eps to stop Chebfun from using maps and exponents.

%% 
% As an example we choose the polytropic index to be n=1.5, appropriate to 
% model the structure of a white dwarf.

d = [0,1];
x = chebfun('x',d);
N = chebop(d);
n = 1.5; eps = 1e-8;
N.op = @(x,u,v) x.*diff(u,2) + 2*diff(u) + x.*v.^2.*(u+eps).^n;
N.lbc = @(u,v) [u-1,diff(u)];
N.rbc = @(u,v) u;
% N.init = [1-x.^2,1];
N.init = [cos(pi/2*x),pi];
uv = N\0;

%%

plot(uv,'Linewidth',2), hold on, 
axis([0 1 0 1.05*uv(1,2)]),
title('Solution u and radius v'), legend('u','v')
xlabel('x'), ylabel('u')

%%
% Thus the radius of the polytrope describing the structure of a white
% dwarf is

v = uv(:,2);
fprintf('Polytropic range for white dwarfs: [0,%1.4f)\n',v(1));
