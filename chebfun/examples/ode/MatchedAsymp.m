%%
% A powerful technique for problems with large or small
% parameters is the method of matched asymptotics, where
% approximate solutions accurate in one region of the problem domain 
% are matched to different approximate solutions accurate in
% another region.  This subject is discussed in many books by
% authors including Bender & Orszag, Fowler, Howison, Lagerstrom,
% Nayfeh, and van Dyke.

%%
% For example, consider the linear boundary-value problem
%
%    -eps*y" + (2-x^2)y = 1,     y(-1) = y(1) = 0
%
% with eps<<1.  In Chebfun, we can set up the problem conveniently
% with a couple of anonymous functions:
d = domain(-1,1);
x = chebfun('x',d);
L = @(eps) -eps*diff(d,2) + diag(2-x.^2) & 'dirichlet';
y = @(eps) L(eps)\1;

%%
% Here are the solutions for three values of eps:
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize';
figure, tic
for j = 1:4
   eps = 10^(-j);
   yeps = y(eps);
   subplot(2,2,j), plot(yeps,LW,1.6), hold on
   grid on, axis([-1.05 1.05 0 1])
   title(sprintf('eps = %4.1e     npts = %d',eps,length(yeps)),FS,8)
end

% It is clear almost at a glance what form the solution is
% taking as eps decreases to zero.  Away from -1 and +1, the
% eps*y" term is negligible and the solution is approximately
% that of the rest of the equation, 
%
%     y_interior = 1/(2-x^2).
%
% Near -1 and 1, on the other hand, eps*y" becomes significant
% as the solution quickly bends down to meet the boundary condition.

%%
% In matched asymptotics the solution away from the boundary
% layers is called the "outer solution".  Here we have two
% boundary layers, each of which has an "inner solution".
% To analyze the right boundary layer, for example, we make
% the approximation x=1.  This gives a constant coefficient
% second-order equation, with an exponentially growing solution
% exp(x/sqrt(eps)) and an exponentially decaying solution
% exp(-x/sqrt(eps)).  One of our two free parameters is used up
% by the fact that only the first of these is appropriate
% at the right boundary.  The other parameter is used to satisfy
% the boundary condition, giving
%
%     y_right = 1 - exp((x-1)/sqrt(eps)).
%
% Similarly at the left boundary we have
%
%     y_left = 1 - exp(-x-1)/sqrt(eps)).

%%
% The three solutions can be combined to give an asymptotic
% model valid throughout [-1,1]:
model = @(eps) 1./(2-x.^2) - exp((x-1)/sqrt(eps)) - exp((-x-1)/sqrt(eps));

%%
% Let us superimpose the prediction of this model, a dashed red
% line, on the plots as before
for j = 1:4
   eps = 10^(-j);
   subplot(2,2,j)
   meps = model(eps);
   plot(meps,'--r',LW,1.6)
   grid on, axis([-1.05 1.05 0 1])
end

%%
% It is interesting to plot and measure the differences
% between the true solution and the model:
for j = 1:4
   eps = 10^(-j);
   subplot(2,2,j)
   yeps = y(eps);
   meps = model(eps);
   hold off, plot(meps-yeps,'m',LW,1.6)
   grid on, xlim([-1.05 1.05])
   err = norm(yeps-meps,inf);
   title(sprintf('eps = %4.1e     err = %5.2e',eps,err),FS,8)
end

%%
% These plots reveal global convergence at a rate O(sqrt(eps))as
% eps shrinks to zero, with the maximal error being attained
% in a matching region near the boundaries of width O(sqrt(eps)).
% In the interior the accuracy is higher, O(eps).

%%
% Matched asymptotics is a highly developed field and has
% been applied to linear and nonlinear problems of all kinds.
% A linear problem with a variable coefficient may have
% interior as well as boundary layers, and for a nonlinear
% problem there may be interior layers at arbitrary locations.
