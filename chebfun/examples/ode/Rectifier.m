%% Half-wave rectifier

%%
% The initial-value problem 
% 
%   v' + ep*v = ep*(exp(alpha(sin(t)-v)) - 1), v(0)=0
%
% models a half-wave rectifier that converts AC current into DC. With
% small values of ep and large values of alpha, it is very stiff.

%%
% We start off with a mild form of the problem.
ep = 1e-3;  alpha = 10;
N = chebop(0,30);
N.op = @(t,v) diff(v) + ep*v - ep*( exp(alpha*(sin(t)-v)) - 1 );
N.lbc = 0;    % initial condition
v_10 = N\0;

%%
% As you can see above, the solution v(t) requires a rather large degree
% polynomial to represent it. The system is characterized by rapid jumps
% between slowly varying plateaus, and the jumps require high resolution.
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2; 
plot(v_10,LW,lw)
xlabel('t'), ylabel('v(t)'), 
title(['alpha = ',num2str(alpha),', length(v) = ',int2str(length(v_10))])

%%
% If we steepen the jumps by making the problem more stiff, we are well
% advised to "continue from" the previous solution, by using it as the
% initial guess to nonlinear iterations. This is done by setting the .init
% field of N. The representation length will close in on 1025, which is the
% default maximum size, so we increase it temporarily.

% A comparison to one of Matlab's trusty built-in IVP solvers gives us some
% reason to wonder what's really happening in this equation.

%%
% The issue is that the solutions are so sensitive that the default error
% settings in ODE15S are inappropriate. This is easily fixed if you know
% what to do, and we can verify that Chebfun was right all along. 
opt = odeset('reltol',1e-10,'abstol',1e-10);

%%
% Currently Chebfun is not a competitive way to solve most initial-value
% problems in terms of speed. But it does offer high accuracy as its
% default mode of operation. The accuracy also extends to answering
% questions such as, "When do all the local voltage peaks occur?"

% Getting an equivalent answer from built-in methods will take some
% know-how and lots of squinting at graphs for good initial estimates.
