%% An Allen-Cahn equation with continuation

%%
% The Allen-Cahn equation is a reaction-diffusion that arises in material
% science: u_tt = Eps*u"+u-u^3=, where Eps is a small parameter.  Here as
% an ODE boundary-value problem we shall consider a steady-state version 
% of this problem on the interval [0,10] with a sinusouidal forcing term:
%
% Eps*u" + u - u^3 = sin(x),    u(0) = 1,  u(10) = -1.

%%
% If we try a very small value of Eps without a well-chosen initial guess,
% Chebfun will not converge.  Instead let's begin by solving the problem
% with the rather large initial guess Eps = 1:
Eps = 1;
dom = [0,10];
x = chebfun('x',dom);
f = sin(x);
cheboppref('plotting',0.01)
N = chebop(@(u) Eps*diff(u,2)+u-u.^3,dom,1,-1);
tic, u = N\f; t = toc;

LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 14;
close, plot(u,LW,lw)
s = 'Eps = %5.1e    length(u) = %d    time = %3.1f secs';
title(sprintf(s,Eps,length(u),t),FS,fs)

%%
% We now progressively reduce Eps to get sharper and sharper solutions. We
% use a simple continuation method, in which the initial guess for each
% iteration is the previous solution.
Epsvec = [.5 .2 .1 .03 .009 .003];
for j = 1:length(Epsvec)
  close all
  Eps = Epsvec(j);
  N = chebop(@(u) Eps*diff(u,2)+u-u.^3,dom,1,-1);
  N.guess = u;
  tic, u = N\f; t = toc;
  close, plot(u,LW,lw)
  title(sprintf(s,Eps,length(u),t),FS,fs), snapnow
