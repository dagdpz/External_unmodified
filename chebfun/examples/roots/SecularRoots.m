% Sometimes one needs to find the roots
% of a rational function expressed in partial fraction form, like this:
% 
%   r(x) = 1 + SUM_j=0^N  a_j/(b_j-x) .
%
% For example, a "secular equation" of this kind arises in numerical
% linear algebra as part of the divide and conquer algorithm for
% computing eigenvalues of symmetric matrices (see [1] and p. 231 of [2]).
% If the coefficients a_j are positive and the poles b_j are distinct,
% then r must switch from +inf to -inf as x passes through each pole,
% and it follows that r has exactly N-1 real zeros lying between the
% poles and also one more real zero lying to the right of all the poles.

%%
% Here is an example with N=4:
x = chebfun('x',[-5 10]);
for j = 1:4
  f = 1 + 1./(1-x) + 1./(2-x) + 1./(3-x) + 1./(4-x);
end
hold off, plot(f,'linewidth',2), grid on

%%
% Chebfun can compute the roots:
r = roots(f)

%%
% Notice that the result is 8 numbers, including the poles as well as the
% roots.  This is because Chebfun's convention is to regard a function as
% having a root at any point where it crosses between positive and negative
% values.  

%%
% Let us add the roots to the plot.
hold on, plot(r,f(r),'.r','markersize',24)
