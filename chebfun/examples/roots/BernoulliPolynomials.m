%% 
% If there is another class of polynomials that is as fascinating and
% important  to mathematics as orthogonal polynomials, then these are
% probably the Bernoulli polynomials B_j(x), deg(B_j) = j. These
% polynomials appear in the most different areas of mathematics, and have a
% variety of applications. In this example we have cited from the excellent
% Wikipedia articles [1] and [2], and a talk of Karl Dilcher [3].
%
% Bernoulli polynomials are typically defined on the interval [0,1]. They
% can be generated recursively by integrating and adding a constant such
% that the definite integral equals zero. Let us build a quasimatrix whose
% (j+1)-st column is B_j(x), and plot the first 13 polynomials:

close all; clear all
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2; format short
x = chebfun('x',[0,1]);
B(:,1) = 0*x + 1;
for j = 1:100,
    B(:,j+1) = j*cumsum(B(:,j));
    B(:,j+1) = B(:,j+1) - sum(B(:,j+1));
end
plot(B(:,1:13),LW,lw)
axis([0,1,-.3,.3])

%%
% The function values B_j(0) are called Bernoulli numbers. Here are the
% first 14 Bernoulli numbers:

B(0,1:14)

%%
% These numbers turn out to be the Taylor coefficients of z/(exp(z)-1).
% Moreover, they are related to certain function values of the famous
% Riemann zeta function at integer arguments. In fact, the unresolved
% Riemann Hypothesis has an alternative reformulation due to Marcel Riesz
% (1916) in terms of Bernoulli numbers! Matlab doesn't come with a ZETA
% function, but if you have one available (see [4], for example), we can
% verify that the function values f(j), j = 0,...,13, coincide with the
% above Bernoulli numbers (for j = 1 the sign is switched):

if exist('zeta','file')
    f = chebfun(@(x) -x.*zeta(1-x),[0,13]);
    plot(f,LW,lw); hold on
    j = 0:13;
    f(j)
    plot(j,f(j),'ro',LW,lw); 
    axis([0,13,-.4,1.1]); 
    hold off
end

%%
% Note that (except for j = 1) every second Bernoulli number is zero. These
% correspond to the trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Using the
% above function f (and a generalization involving the so-called Hurwitz
% zeta function), one can define Bernoulli numbers (and polynomials) of
% non-integer index.

%%
% Bernoulli polynomials have the property that the number of (distinct) 
% roots in the interval [0,1] is at most 3. We can easily verify this 
% assertion numerically:

for j = 1:100,
    nrRoots(1,j) = length(roots(B(:,j)));
end
nrRoots(1:14)
fprintf('The maximal number of roots is %d.\n',max(nrRoots))

%%
% The multiplicity and location of complex roots has been of interest to 
% many mathematicians over a long time. It is now known that all roots
% of the Bernoulli polynomials are distinct (Brillhart 1969, Dilcher 2008). 
% It is also known that there exists a parabolic region above and below
% the interval [0,1] which is free of roots (Dilcher 1983/88):

figure
for j = 1:20,
    r = roots(B(:,j),'all');
    plot(r+1i*eps,'b*')
    hold on
end
hold off

%%
% Another interesting observation is the following: If one appropriately 
% scales the even/odd Bernoulli polynomials, then these converge to 
% cosine/sine functions, respectively. Let us visualize the first 50 
% rescaled Bernoulli polynomials of odd degree, and compute the distance 
% to the expected limit function in the uniform norm:

err = [];
limit = sin(2*pi*x);
for j = 1:50,
    b = (-1)^(j)*(2*pi)^(2*j-1)/2/factorial(2*j-1)*B(:,2*j);
    plot(b)
    err(2*j) = norm(b - limit,inf);
    hold on
end
hold off

%%
% It is known that this convergence is geometric with rate 0.5:

semilogy(err,'b*','MarkerSize',10)
hold on
semilogy(0.5.^(0:99),'r--',LW,lw)
hold off
axis([0,100,1e-16,1])

%% 
% The last property we like to mention and visualize here is the behavior 
% of extrema of Bernoulli polynomials on [0,1]. D. H. Lehmer (1940) showed 
% that the j-th degree Bernoulli polynomial is bounded by 
% 
%    2*factorial(j)/(2*pi)^j
%
% for j > 1, except when j is 2 modulo 4, in which case the bound becomes 
%
%    2*zeta(j)*factorial(j)/(2*pi)^j, 
%
% again with the Riemann zeta function.

fact = cumprod([1,1:99]); 
bound = 2*fact./(2*pi).^(0:99);
for j = 1:100,
    M(j) = max(B(:,j));
    if mod(j-1,4) == 2 && exist('zeta','file')
        bound(j) = bound(j)*zeta(j-1);
    end
end
semilogy(M,LW,lw);
hold on
semilogy(bound,'r--',LW,lw)
axis([0,100,1e-5,1e80])

%% 
% This bound looks quite sharp, and in fact, if one would remove the
% zeta(j) factor from the bound then it would be invalid every
% 4-th index.
