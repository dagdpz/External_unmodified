% In their article ``Another Look at the Chebyshev Polynomials'' [1] from
% 1983, E. L. Ortiz and T. J. Rivlin considered the graph of 30 Chebyshev
% polynomials T_j(x), noticing the appearance of what they called "white
% curves":

plot(chebpoly(1:30),'b-')
hold on

%%
% The white curves are regions in the graph with exceptionally many intersection
% points of Chebyshev polynomials. Ortiz and Rivlin show that if 
% 0 < m <= n and T_m(x) = T_n(x) = y, then 
% 
%    (1 - T_{n-m}(x)) * (T_2(y) - T_{n-m}(x)) = 0.
%
% Hence the interior intersection points of Chebyshev polynomials
% must lie on the curve (x,y) satisfying T_2(y) = T_{n-m}(x).
% Smaller numbers of n-m correspond to smaller numbers of intersection
% points. Here are the intersection points obtained with n-m <= 4,
% obtained with Chebfun's rootfinding capability:

T_2 = chebpoly(2);
for j = 1:4,        % j = n-m
    T_j = chebpoly(j);
    for y = linspace(-1,1,200),
        x = roots(T_j - T_2(y));
        plot(x,y,'r.');
    end
end

%%
% Ortiz and Rivlin also noted that the phenomenon of white curves 
% persists for other orthogonal polynomials as well. For example,
% let's take the Legendre polynomials and plot them with some
% appropriate reweighting:

figure
x = chebfun('x');
for j = 1:30,
    L = legpoly(j);
    q = (pi*j/2)^.5*(1-x.^2).^.25;
    plot(L.*q);
    hold on
end

%% 
% It is easy to compute the points (x,y) satisfying L_2(y) = L_j(x) just
% as before. They have no particular meaning in this case, but they
% appear as a nice pattern:

figure
L_2 = legpoly(2);
for j = 1:4,        % j = n-m
    L_j = legpoly(j);
    for y = linspace(-1,1,200),
        x = roots(L_j - L_2(y));
        if(~isempty(x)), plot(x,y,'r.'); hold on; end
    end
end
