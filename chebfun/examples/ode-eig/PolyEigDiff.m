%% Bessel functions as eigenvectors of polynomial eigenvalue problems
% The eigenfunctions of polynomial eigenvalue problems with differential
% operators can often be interpreted as solutions of certain differential
% equations. Our first example is the differential equation
%
%   x^2*y''(x) + x*y'(x) + (x^2-alpha^2)*y(x) = 0,
%
% which is satisfied by the Bessel functions. We may easily verify this
% with Chebfun by looking at the residual norm of this equation for the
% Bessel functions of the first kind of orders alpha = 0,...,5:

dom = [0 100];
x = chebfun(@(x) x, dom);
for alpha = 0:5,
    y = chebfun(@(x)besselj(alpha,x),dom);
    r = x.^2.*diff(y,2) + x.*diff(y,1) + (x.^2 - alpha^2).*y;
    fprintf('%d   %4.2e\n',alpha,norm(r))
end;

%% 
% Let's consider, say, the Bessel function of order alpha = 5 and compute
% its roots on [0,100];
alpha = 5;
bessel5 = chebfun(@(x)besselj(alpha,x),dom);
rts = roots(bessel5);

%%
% We may reformulate the above differential equation into a polynomial
% eigenvalue problem: Between two of its roots, each Bessel function is (up
% to scaling) an eigenvector with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary values
% associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the polynomial eigenvalue problem:
%
%   lambda^2*x^2*y'' + lambda*x*y' + (x^2-alpha^2)*y = 0

%%
% Using the POLYEIGS command of Chebfun, we can verify
% this assertion numerically on the domain given by the, say, 1st and 22nd
% root of our Bessel function:

dom = [rts(1),rts(22)];
A = chebop(@(x,y) (x.^2 - alpha^2).*y, dom);
B = chebop(@(x,y) x.*diff(y), dom);
C = chebop(@(x,y) x.^2.*diff(y,2), dom);
C.bc = 'dirichlet';

[V,D] = polyeigs(A,B,C,1,1);

D

%% 
% We may compare the exact Bessel function of order 5 with the computed
% eigenvector V (after rescaling):

LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.6;
plot(bessel5,LW,lw)
dd = diff(dom);
s = bessel5(dd)/V(dd);
hold on
plot(s*V,'r--',LW,lw);
hold off

norm(s*V-bessel5{dom(1),dom(2)})

%%
% We could also compute further eignmodes and eigenfunctions of this
% operator (although we don't claim that they have much physical relevance
% in this case!).

[V,D] = polyeigs(A,B,C,3,1);
D
plot(V,LW,lw)

%% Accuracy of polynomial eigenvalues
% To check the accuracy of the polynomial eigensolver of Chebfun, we
% consider the following linear ordinary differential equation
%
%  lambda^2*c*y''(x) + lambda*b*y'(x) + a*y(x) = 0,
%  y(0) = y(1) = 0.
%
% We compute, say, 5 eigenvalues lambda closest to 1 of the associated
% polynomial eigenvalue problem:

dom = [0 1]; a = 4; b = 1; c = 2;
A = chebop(@(y) a*y, dom);
B = chebop(@(y) b*diff(y), dom);
C = chebop(@(y) c*diff(y,2), dom);
C.bc = 'dirichlet'; 
[V,D] = polyeigs(A,B,C,5,1);

%%
% This is what the eigenvectors look like:

plot(V,LW,lw)

%%
% and here is the norm of the quasimatrix whose columns are the residuals
% of the computed eigenvectors:

norm(A*V + B*V*diag(D) + C*V*diag(D)^2)

%% 
% Because the problem is linear, the eigenvalues are known exactly and can
% be compared to the computed ones, which turn out to be pretty accurate:

d = sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c)/(2*a);
k = (1:5)';
lambda = 2*d./(k*pi*1i);
