%% 
% Researchers at the University of Delaware are exploring the use of
% quantum dot arrays (QDA) to capture solar energy. One simplified model of
% a QDA is as a 1-D Schr√∂dinger eigenvalue problem. The governing equation
% is
%
%    -(hbar^2/2m) psi'' + U(x) psi = E psi,
%
% where psi(x) is the wavefunction, hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2 pi, 
% m is an effective mass, E is an allowed energy, and U(x) is a potential
% with wells representing the quantum dots. We will take psi=0 far from 
% the wells to supply boundary conditions.

%%
% Here are some dimensional parameters corresponding to physical experiments.
% Space is measured in nm and energy is in eV. 

hbar = 1.054e-34;
m = [0.067 0.022]*9.109e-31*1.602e-37;  % effective mass of InAs and GaAs

numwell = 4;   % number of wells
width = 6.5;  depth = 0.85;  spacing = 3;   % well parameters

%% 
% From the well parameters we will find the boundaries of each well, then
% add endpoints far out to each side.
x = cumsum( [0 repmat([width spacing],1,numwell)] );  
x = [ -10*spacing, x(1:end-1), x(end)+9*spacing ];   

%%
% Now we create the potential U as a piecewise constant function. We use a
% syntax that is compact but opaque: create a cell array of the constant
% values, one per subinterval.
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.6;
vals = [repmat([depth 0],1,numwell) depth];  % [ 0 -depth 0 ... -depth 0 ]
vals = mat2cell(vals,1,ones(1,2*numwell+1));  % convert to cell
U = chebfun(vals,x);
plot(U,LW,lw), ylabel('potential')
xlim(x([1 end]))

%%
% The effective mass is also piecewise constant, so we go through the same
% motions.
vals = [repmat(m,1,numwell) m(1)];
vals = mat2cell(vals,1,ones(1,2*numwell+1));  % convert to cell
emass = chebfun(vals,x);

%%
% Now we are ready to define the Schrodinger operator. 
N = chebop(@(psi) -hbar^2./(2*emass).*diff(psi,2) + U.*psi, x);  
N.lbc = 0; N.rbc = 0;  

%%
% We find the numwell lowest allowed energies and their wavefunctions.
% Rather than getting one isolated wavefunction "bump" per well, we see
% that the wells influence one another strongly. 
[Psi,E] = eigs(N,numwell,0);  
energies = diag(E)
subplot(2,1,1)
plot(U,LW,lw), ylabel('potential'), xlim(x([1 end]))
subplot(2,1,2)
plot(Psi,LW,lw), ylabel('wavefunction'), xlim(x([1 end]))

%% 
% If we look at probability, we find that the first four modes extend
% significantly over all wells. This is "delocalization" or quantum 
% tunnelling, and it means the device can conduct electricity. 
clf
semilogy(Psi.^2,LW,lw), ylabel('probability'), 
axis( [x([2 end-1]) 1e-3 1e-1]  )

%%
% In practice, though, the potential wells cannot be fabricated
% identically. A brief experiment shows that the delocalization
% deteriorates even with small fluctuations in the well depths. Here we
% perturb by 2% variance.
vals = [repmat([depth 0],1,numwell) depth];  % [ 0 -depth 0 ... -depth 0 ]

randn('state',1138)
vals(2:2:end) = vals(2:2:end) + 0.017*randn(1,numwell);

vals = mat2cell(vals,1,ones(1,2*numwell+1));  % convert to cell
U = chebfun(vals,x);

%% 
% Now we find that the wavefunctions extend significantly over just one or
% two wells.
N.op = @(psi) -hbar^2./(2*emass).*diff(psi,2) + U.*psi;
