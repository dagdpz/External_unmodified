%% The Nullspace of Linear Operators

%%
% We've recently introduced some new functionality in Chebfun for computing
% the nullspace of differential operators. Let's explore this with a couple
% of simple examples!


%% Simple Example #1
% Let's start as simply as we can, and take
%
%     u"(x) = 0, for x in [-1 1]

L = chebop(@(u) diff(u,2));

%%
% Clearly the nullspace, that is the nontrivial functions v for which 
%
%     L(v) = 0,
%
% for this operator is spanned the two functions

v = [1 chebfun('x')];
norm(L*v)

%%
% Supposing we didn't know this, we could compute the space with the new
% NULL function.

V = null(L)
plot(V)
V'*V
norm(L*V)

%%
% where we find that V'V = I and LV ~ 0 as required. 

%%
% Clearly V doesn't correspond directly to 1 and x, since there is some
% freedom in how we orthogonalise the basis. However, we can check that
% V and {1,x} correspond to the the same spaces by computing the angle
% between the spaces with the SUBSPACE command.

subspace(v,V)


%% Incomplete boundary conditions
% Now let's consider the more complicated 2nd-order operator
%
%     Lu = u'' + .1*(1-x.^2)u' - sin(x)u, x in [-pi pi]                (*)

dom = [-pi pi];
L = chebop(@(x,u) diff(u,2) + .1*x.*(1-x.^2).*diff(u) + sin(x).*u, dom);
x = chebfun('x',dom);

%%
% As before, it has a nullspace of rank 2.

V = null(L)
plot(V)
V'*V
norm(L(x,V(:,1)))
norm(L(x,V(:,2)))

%%
% However, now suppose we impose ONE boundary condition, say Dirichlet at
% the left. This removes ONE degree of freedom, and we are now left with a
% rank 1 nullspace.

L.lbc = 0; 
L.rbc = [];
v = null(L)
plot(v), shg
v'*v
norm(L(x,v))

%%
% Clearly this null vector must satisfy the given condition v(-pi) = 0.


%% An application
% Where might this be useful? Well, suppose we were interested in equation
% (*) with a homogeneous Dirichlet condition at the left, and wanted to
% know what inhomogenous Dirichlet condition gave the minimal 2-norm of the
% solution to Lu = 1.

%%
% Rather than solving the linear system for a number of different boundary
% conditions (which would be computationally expensive) we could simply
% solve for one, say again homogenous Dirichlet

L.rbc = 0;
u = L\1;
hold on, plot(u,'--r'), hold off;

%%
% and compute the rest by adding a scalar multiple of the null-function v.

E = chebfun(@(c) norm(u+c*v,2),'vectorise',[-10 10],'splitting','on');
plot(E)

%%
% We compute the 2-norm as a chebfun in the unknown variable c,
% which we can then minimise to obtain the minimal energy solution

[minE c_star] = min(E)
u_star = u + c_star*v
plot(u_star)

%%
% So the condition we require is that u(pi) = bc_star, where 

bc_star = u_star(pi)

%% Exotic constraints
% The NULL function can also handle the exotic types of boundary conditions
% that can be enforced in Chebfun (see [1]). For example, suppose we wish
% to again compute the null-space of the 3rd-order piecewise-smoooth ODE 
%
%       Lu := 0.001u''' + sign(x)*u'' + u, x in [-1 1]
%
% with the 'boundary' condition that
%
%             sum(u) = u(0).

dom = [-1 1];
L = chebop(@(x,u) 1e-2*diff(u,3) + sign(x).*diff(u,2) + u);
L.lbc = []; L.rbc = [];
L.bc = @(u) sum(u)-u(0);
x = chebfun('x',dom);

%%
% Here NULL has no problems!

V = null(L)
plot(V), shg
V'*V

%%

sum(V(:,1))-V(0,1)
norm(L(x,V(:,1)),1)
sum(V(:,2))-V(0,2)
norm(L(x,V(:,2)),1)
