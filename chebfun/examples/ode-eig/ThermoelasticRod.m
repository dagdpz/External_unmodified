%% Stability of a thermoelastic rod

%%
% Suppose a thermoelastic rod is fixed to a wall at one end and may expand
% to make contact with a wall at the other end. J. R. Barber [1] proposed a
% boundary condition that models a physically realistic transition between
% thermal insulation, when far from contact, and perfect thermal contact.

%%
% Linear stability analysis suggests a change from stable to unstable
% behavior as the temperature difference between the walls increases. The
% eigenvalue problem governing the stability of the perturbation phi(x) is
% nondimensionally
%
%     phi''(x) = lambda*phi(x),   0 < x < 1
%                                              / 1   
%                                             |  
%     phi(0) = 0,  phi'(1) + phi(1) = 4 delta |    phi(x) dx
%                                             |
%                                           0/
%
% where delta is a function of the thermal gradient. The transition from
% stable to unstable happens at delta=1. The presence of the integral of
% phi in the boundary condition makes the problem unusual from a classical
% standpoint, but from the Chebfun point of view it's just another linear
% boundary condition.

% First, we solve the eigenvalue problem in a stable case.
N = chebop( @(u) diff(u,2), [0 1] );    % operator on 0<x<1
N.lbc = 0;     % fixed end
delta = 0.96;  % stable choice 
N.bc = @(x,u) feval(diff(u),1) + u(1) - 4*delta*sum(u);  % Barber condition
[Vs,Ls] = eigs(N,4,0);  % eigenmodes closest to zero

%%
% The eigenvalues are all negative, indicating stability:
diag(Ls) 

%%
% Here is what happens in a slightly unstable case:
delta = 1.02;  % unstable choice
N.bc = @(x,u) feval(diff(u),1) + u(1) - 4*delta*sum(u);  % Barber condition
[Vu,Lu] = eigs(N,4,0);  
diag(Lu)  

%% 
% Here we see the perturbation which is least stable in the first case, or 
% unstable in the second case. 
subplot(1,2,1)
plot(Vs(:,1),LW,1.6)
title(sprintf('Stable, \\lambda = %.3f',Ls(1,1)))
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(Vu(:,1),LW,1.6)
title(sprintf('Unstable, \\lambda = %.3f',Lu(1,1)))

%%
% The solutions above look linear, but they do have significant Chebyshev 
% coefficients out to degree 8.

%%
% Without knowing the transition value delta=1 in advance, we could locate
% it through a simple Chebfun rootfinding search. First, we parameterize
% the boundary conditions and the maximum real eigenvalue.
BC = @(delta) @(x,u) [u(0), feval(diff(u),1) + u(1) - 4*delta*sum(u)];
maxlam = @(delta) eigs( chebop([0,1],@(u)diff(u,2),BC(delta)), 1, 0 );

%%
% Then, we construct a chebfun for the maximum lambda. A polynomial of 
% degree 10 captures the behavior of the maximum eigenvalue to 
% about 11 digits.
stability = chebfun(maxlam,[0.5,2],'eps',1e-11,'vectorize')

%%
% Finally, the transition in stability occurs when the eigenvalue passes
% through zero. 
dstar = find(stability==0)
clf, plot(stability,LW,1.6), hold on, plot(dstar,0,'r*')
xlabel('\delta'), ylabel('max \lambda'), grid on
