%% Can one hear the shape of a chebfun?

% NOTE: THIS EXAMPLE PRODUCES NOISE (provided your sound card is properly
% configured). CHEBTUNE.M is available in the latest Chebfun development
% release, or here [1]. You can find .wav files of the audio output
% produced in this Example here [2].

%%
% The CHEBTUNE function listed below can turn your chebfuns into melodies.
% It works as follows: The chebfun is sampled at sufficiently many
% equispaced points on its domain, and then according to the real part of
% these samples the pitch of the melody is varied. The function value 0 is
% associated with the tone c'' and the integers below and above correspond
% to the semi-tones. A second argument of CHEBTUNE adjusts the duration of
% the melody.
%
% Here is a chromatic tone progression over one octave, played for a
% duration of 6 seconds:

x = chebfun('x',[0,13]);
y = floor(x);
plot(y)
set(gca,'YTick',0:12,'YTickLabel',...
    {'c','c#','d','d#','e','f','f#','g','g#','a','a#','b','c'})
title('chromatic scale')
chebtune(y,6);


%%
% Note that CHEBTUNE is different from the SOUND function in that it does
% not interpret the chebfun as a waveform, but as a melody. CHEBTUNE can
% also play chords when a quasi-matrix argument is provided. Here is a C
% major chord being continuously shifted to an E minor chord:

x = chebfun('x',[0,1]);
Y = [ 0 + 4*x.^2 , 4 + 3*x.^2 , 7+4*x.^2 ];
plot(Y);
grid on
set(gca,'YTick',0:12,'YTickLabel',...
    {'c','c#','d','d#','e','f','f#','g','g#','a','a#','b','c'})
title('morphing two chords')
chebtune(Y,4)


%%
% Here is the sound of a whistle. Note that we have added some
% high-frequency oscillation to make the result sound less like a pure sine
% wave.

x = chebfun('x',[0,1.3]);
y = min(6*cos(3*(x-.1)) + 1*(1-x).^-1,12);
y = y + 0.3*sin(1000*x);
y(domain([0,.3])) = NaN;
y(domain([1,1.3])) = NaN;
plot(y)
title('whistle sound')
chebtune(y,1)


%%
% Did you know that the sound of a police car can be described by a
% quasi-matrix with two columns?

x = chebfun('x');
Y = [9+6*sin(46*x),7+10*sin(4*x)];
plot(Y)
title('police car')
chebtune(Y,5);

%% 
% We wonder if CHEBTUNE could be any useful for vision impaired users of
% Chebfun. A person with a trained ear you should be able to tell roughly
% the shape of a function by just listening. And with the reference tone
% c'' one could also hear the number of roots of this function:

x = chebfun('x');
y = 4*cos(x.^2) - 6*sin(3*x).^2;
Y = [ y , 0*y ];
chebtune(Y,4)
