% One ingredient that makes Chebyshev interpolation so powerful
% is the small Lebesgue constant L(n) associated with the Chebyshev
% nodes cos(pi*(0:n)/(n+1)). The number 1 + L(n) is the factor by 
% which the uniform best approximation of a continuous function f(x)
% may outperform polynomial interpolation at the corresponding nodes. 
% The Lebesgue constant for Chebyshev nodes is asymptotically
%
%    L(n) ~ (2/pi)*log(n), 
%
% which is a mild growth in n, whereas for n equispaced nodes it's
% growing exponentially 
%
%    L(n) ~ 2^n/(e*n*log(n)). 
%
% (See also Chapter 15 of http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/ATAP/)
%  
% Roughly speaking, a small Lebesgue constant also suggests that 
% a Chebyshev interpolant stays close to interpolation data f(x), 
% provided that the polynomial best approximant of the same degree 
% is also close to f(x).
%
% Let's illustrate the above with the following continuous function 
% g(x) resembling a labyrinth.

g = chebfun('0',[0,400]);
j = 0; ell = 0; d = 1;
while j < 400,
    if isreal(d),
        ell = ell + 1;
    end;
    g(domain([j,j+ell])) = d;
    d = 1i*d; j = j + ell;
end;
g = cumsum(g);
plot(g,'k-');
axis([-1,1,-1,1]*11)
axis square

%%
% Imagine that Minotaurus is sitting in the centre of this
% dark labyrinth and we want to give it a description of how 
% to escape without hitting the wall. One such description is 
% given by the piecewise linear path f:

f = -g + .5 + .5i;
hold on
plot(f,'r');

%% 
% Note that Minotaurus needs to change direction 38 times:

f.nfuns - 1

%%
% Yet another description for escaping this labyrinth is
% encoded by as few as 201 Chebyshev coefficients, i.e., by
% a Chebyshev interpolant of degree 200 (the * indicating
% the interpolation nodes):

figure
plot(g,'k-');
hold on
p = chebfun(f,[0,400],201,'splitting','off');
plot(p,'r-*');
axis([-1,1,-1,1]*11)
axis square

%%
% In contrast to Chebyshev interpolation, interpolation in 
% equispaced nodes results in immediate instability, even for 
% a degree as small as 20:

figure
plot(g,'k-');
hold on
x = linspace(0,400,21);
px = polyfit(x,f(x),length(x)-1,domain([0,400]));
plot(px,'r-*');
axis([-1,1,-1,1]*11)
axis square

%%
% Inspired by the fact that Chebyshev interpolants can stay
% very close to continuous piecewise linear data f(x), the
% Chebfun system contains an implementation of the well-known 
% game "Snake" (or "Nibbles") based on a Chebyshev interpolant 
% to a moving piecewise linear function.

% chebsnake.m will soon be appearing in the next Chebfun release, 
% but for now it is available at 
%   http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/examples/approx/chebsnake.m

%%
% To play, download this file and type:

chebsnake;

%%
% If this is too easy for you, you may try to play this game
% with a polynomial interpolant through equispaced nodes:

chebsnake('equi');

%% 
% You may also try barycentric rational interpolation as described 
% by Floater and Hormann (Numerische Mathematik, 2007), an option
% implemented by Georges Klein. Because this is a rational interpolant, 
% it can remain close to our piecewise linear f(x) even when the 
% interpolation nodes are equispaced:

chebsnake('fh');
