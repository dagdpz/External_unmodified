%% Shape analysis on a beach holiday
% Procrustes shape analysis is a statistical method for analysing the
% distribution of sets of shapes (see [1]). Let's suppose we pick up a
% pebble from the beach and want to know how close its shape matches the
% outline of an frisbee. Here is a plot of the frisbee and the beach
% pebble.

figure(1);
t=chebfun('x',[0,2*pi]);
f=3*(1.5*cos(t) + 1i*sin(t)); %frisbee
g=exp(1i*pi/3)*(1+cos(t)+1.5i*sin(t)+ .125*(1+1.5i)*sin(3*t).^2); %pebble
plot(f,'r','LineWidth',2), hold on, axis equal, plot(g,'k','LineWidth',2); 
title('Frisbee and pebble','FontSize',16); hold off;

%% 
% Two shapes are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by
% translating, scaling and rotating. Before comparison we thus:

%%
% 1. Translate the shapes so they have mean zero.

%%
% 2. Scale so the shapes have Root Mean Squared Distance (RMSD) to the
% origin of one.

%% 
% 3. Rotate to align major axis.

%% 
% Here is how the frisbee and the pebble compare after each stage.

function [f,g]=ShapeAnalysis(f,g)
    % SHAPEANALYSIS(F,G) Plots the parameterised curves before and after
    % each stage of translating, scaling and aligning. Outputs are
    % parameterised curves ready for Procustes shape analysis.
    
    LW = 'LineWidth'; FS = 'FontSize';
    % Plot orignal
    subplot(2,2,1)
    plot(f,'r',LW,2), hold on, axis equal, plot(g,'k',LW,2)
    title('Orignal',FS,16)

    % Translate mean to 0.
    f = f-mean(f); g = g-mean(g); 
    subplot(2,2,2)
    plot(f,'r',LW,2), hold on, axis equal, plot(g,'k',LW,2)
    title('After translation',FS,16)

    % Scale so RMSD is 1.
    f = f/norm(f); g = g/norm(g);
    subplot(2,2,3)
    plot(f,'r',LW,2), hold on, axis equal, plot(g,'k',LW,2)
    title('After scaling',FS,16)

    % Align major axis.
    subplot(2,2,4)
    % Find argument of major axis.
    [~,fxmax]=max(abs(f)); [~,gxmax]=max(abs(g));
    rotf=angle(f(fxmax)); rotg=angle(g(gxmax));
    % Rotate both so major axis lies on the +ve real axis.
    x = chebfun('x',[0,2*pi]);
    f = exp(-1i*rotf)*f(mod(x+fxmax,2*pi));
    g = exp(-1i*rotg)*g(mod(x+gxmax,2*pi));
    plot(f,'r',LW,2), hold on, axis equal, plot(g,'k',LW,2)
    title('After aligning',FS,16), hold off
end

[f,g] = ShapeAnalysis(f,g);

% To calculate the Procrustes distance we would measure the error between
% the two shapes at a finite number of reference points and compute the
% vector 2-norm. In this discrete case In Chebfun we calculate the
% continuous analogue:

norm(f-g)

%% A little warning
% In the discrete version of Procrustes shape analysis statisticians choose
% reference points on the two shapes (to compare).  They then work out the
% difference between corresponding reference points.  The error computed
% depends on this correspondence.  A different correspondence gives a
% different error.   In the continuous case this correspondence becomes the
% parameterisation. A different parameterisation of the two curves gives a
% different error. This continuous version of Procrustes (as implemented in
% this example) is therefore more of an 'eye-ball' check than a robust
% statistical analysis.

%% A shape and its reflection
% At the beach shapes reflect on the surface of the sea. An interesting 
% question is: How close, in shape, is a pebble to its reflection?  Here is
% a plot of a pebble and its reflection. 

figure(2)
% pebble
f = exp(1i*pi/3)*(1+cos(t)+1.5i*sin(t)+.125*(1+1.5i)*sin(3*t).^2); 
% reflection
g = exp(-1i*pi/3)*(1+cos(2*pi-t)-1.5i*sin(2*pi-t)+.125*(1-1.5i)*sin(3*(2*pi-t)).^2);

plot(f,'r','LineWidth',2), hold on, axis equal, plot(g,'k','LineWidth',2) 
title('Pebble and its reflection','FontSize',16), hold off

%%
% Here is how the pebble and its reflection compare after each stage of
% translating, scaling and rotating.

[f,g]=ShapeAnalysis(f,g);

%%
% Now we calculate the continuous Procrustes distance. 
norm(f-g)

%%
% Comparing this result to the Procrustes distance of the pebble and a
% frisbee shows that the pebble is closer in shape to a frisbee than its own
% reflection!
