% With Chebfun it is easy to compute with parametrized
% curves in the plane. 
% For example, the following lines define a curve
% (x,y) as a pair of chebfuns in the variable t:

t = chebfun('t',[0,2*pi]);
b = 1; m = 7; a = (m-1)*b;
x = (a+b)*cos(t) - b*cos((a+b)/b*t);
y = (a+b)*sin(t) - b*sin((a+b)/b*t);

%%
% Such curves are called epicycloids, named by the Danish 
% astronomer Ole Romer in 1674. Epicycloids can be produced 
% by tracing a point on a circle which rolls out on a
% larger circle. RÃ¸mer discovered that cog-wheels with 
% epicycloidal teeth turned with minimum friction. 
% This is what our epicycloid looks like:

LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.6;
plot(x,y,LW,lw)
axis equal

%% 
% Note that although this curve is not smooth, the
% functions x(t) and y(t) that parameterize it are
% smooth, so Chebfun has no difficulty representing 
% them by global polynomials:

x
y

%%
% With the following formula we can compute the area 
% enclosed by the curve (x,y):

format long
A = sum(x.*diff(y))

%%
% Let's compare this result with the exact area of the
% epicycloid, given (for integer m) by the formula

exact = pi*b^2*(m^2+m)

%%
% Here is a more complicated curve (now defined as a
% single complex-valued chebfun rather than a pair of
% real-valued chebfuns):

z = exp(1i*t) + (1+1i)*sin(6*t).^2;
plot(z,LW,lw)
axis equal

%% 
% Because this curve is a perturbed unit circle, with
% every perturbation occurring twice with opposite 
% signs, the enclosed area should equal pi, as is 
% confirmed by Chebfun:

A = sum(real(z).*diff(imag(z)));
[ A ; pi ]

%%
% We can compute and plot the centroid (or center of 
% mass) of this region as follows:

c = sum(diff(z).*z.*conj(z))/(2i*A);
hold on
plot(c,'r+',LW,lw)

%%
% If you use scissors to produce a piece of paper in this 
% shape, it should remain balanced when placed 
% on a vertical needle centered at the red cross.
% (If it doesn't, it's likely your handicraft precision 
% isn't as good as Chebfun's!)
