%%
% A well-known PDE problem is the heat equation initial
% boundary-value problem posed for x in [a,b] and t > 0,
%
%   u_t = u_xx,  u(x,0) = u0(x)
%
% with suitable boundary conditions.
% We can regard this as a time-dependent linear process
%
%   u_t = Lu
%
% where L is the operator d^2/dx^2 on [a,b] with the same
% boundary conditions.  The solution is
%
%   u(t) = e^(tL) u(0).

%%
% In Chebfun we can implement this idea using the EXPM command
% to compute the operator exponential.
% Here is an example with Neumann boundary conditions on
% the interval [0,6].  We start with quite an irregular
% initial function.
d = [0,6]; 
u0 = chebfun(@(x) sign((-1).^floor(x.^1.5)),d,'splitting','on');
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 16;
clf, plot(u0,LW,lw), grid on
title(sprintf('t = %4.2f     length = %d',0,length(u0)),FS,fs)
ax = [0 6 -1.2 1.2]; axis(ax)

%%
% Here's the solution at t = 0.01.  Notice that the narrower spikes
% have lost more amplitude than the wider ones.
% The warning message is important:
% Chebfun does not always give its full accuracy for computations of
% this kind.
L = chebop(d);          % operator on domain [0,6]
L.op = @(u) diff(u,2);  % 2nd-derivative operator
L.lbc = @(u) diff(u);   % Neumann BC at left
L.rbc = @(u) diff(u);   % Neumann BC at right
dt = 0.01;
expmL = expm(dt*L);     % exponential of the operator
u = expmL*u0;
plot(u,LW,lw), axis(ax), grid on
title(sprintf('t = %4.2f     length = %d',0.01,length(u)),FS,fs)

%%
% Here is the solution at t = 0.02.  Now that the function is smooth,
% there are no further warning messages.  The rightmost maximum has extra
% amplitude, since it effectively corresponded to a wider initial spike
% thanks to the Neumann boundary condition.
u = expmL*u;
plot(u,LW,lw), axis(ax), grid on
title(sprintf('t = %4.2f     length = %d',0.02,length(u)),FS,fs)

% At t = 0.1, there is not much of the original structure left.  The
% length of the chebfun has also been reduced.
u = expm(0.08*L)*u;
plot(u,LW,lw), axis(ax), grid on
