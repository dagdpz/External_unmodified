%% Coupled system of reaction-diffusion equations

% We model the concentrations of three chemicals u, v, and w contained 
% in a tube. u and v are intially located at either end of the tube 
% with profiles u0 and v0, but as they diffuse along the tube they 
% meet, react, and produce the third chemical w. The system we arrive
% at is: 
%
%    u_t = 0.1 u" - 100 u v 
%    v_t = 0.2 v" - 100 u v 
%    w_t = 0.001 w" + 200 u v 
%
% with Neumann conditions at the boundaries.

%%
% We work on the unit interval:
d = [-1,1];
x = chebfun('x');

%%
% For initial conditions we take u0 mainly on the left, v0 mainly on the right,
% and w0 equal to zero:
u0 = 1 - erf(10*(x+0.7));
v0 = 1 + erf(10*(x-0.7));
w0 = 0;

%%
% Here is the anonymous function defining the problem for PDE15S.
f = @(u,v,w,D) [ 0.1*D(u,2) - 100*u.*v  ...
                 0.2*D(v,2) - 100*u.*v ...
                .001*D(w,2) + 200*u.*v ];  
%%
% (Here the fourth input, D, points f to the derivative operator.)
            
%%
% We solve the system and plot the result:
[tt uu] = pde15s(f,0:.1:2,[u0 v0 w0],'neumann');
cols = get(0,'DefaultAxesColorOrder');
plot3(0,0,NaN,0,0,NaN,0,0,NaN), hold on     % Used for legend entries
legend('u','v','w') 
for k = 1:numel(uu)
    waterfall(uu{k},tt,'simple','linewidth',1.6,'edgecolor',cols(k,:))
end
FS = 'fontsize';
xlabel('x',FS,14), ylabel('t',FS,14), grid on, hold off
