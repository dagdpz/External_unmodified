% A problem from the Oxford's Numerical Analysis Problem Solving
% Squad in 2006 was, what is the gravitational force F between
% two cubes that are right up against each other?  Each cube
% is a uniform unit mass with unit sides and they are attracted
% by Newton's law with gravitational constant 1. Here's a sketch:

LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.2;
R = [1 .8 .8]; r = [1 .9 .9]; B = [.8 .8 1]; b = [.9 .9 1];
h = fill3([0 1 1 0],[0 0 0 0],[0 0 1 1],b); set(h,LW,lw), hold on
h = fill3([1 2 2 1],[0 0 0 0],[0 0 1 1],r); set(h,LW,lw)
h = fill3([0 0 0 0],[0 1 1 0],[0 0 1 1],B); set(h,LW,lw)
h = fill3([1 2 2 1],[0 0 1 1],[1 1 1 1],R); set(h,LW,lw)
h = fill3([0 1 1 0],[0 0 1 1],[1 1 1 1],B); set(h,LW,lw)
view(342,15), axis equal off
axis([-.02 2 -.01 1 -.01 1])
set(gcf,'position',[560 427 332 214])

% It's easy to write F as a 6-dimensional integral, but it's
% a hard integral to evaluate because of the dimensionality and
% the singularity associated with the faces in contact.
% However, one can reduce the problem to a succession of three 
% integrals corresponding to going up from 0 to 2 dimensions, 
% then to 4, and finally to 6. Each of these integrals can be
% evaluated quickly with Chebfun, taking advantage of Chebfun's 
% ability to work with singularities.

%%
% A more detailed description of the derivation of this approach can be
% found here:
% http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/chebfun/files/TwoCubesEquations.pdf

%%
% To simplify some of the expressions in the work below, we consider 
% the slightly modified problem of cubes with side length 2. At the 
% end we divide by 16, which gives us the solution to the 
% original unit cube problem.

%%
% Our starting point is the gravitational force between two point
% masses. With gravitational constant 1, this is simply
F_Point = @(r) 1./r.^2;
%%
% where r is the Euclidean distance between two points s and y.
r = @(s,y) sqrt(s.^2+y.^2);

%%
% The next step is to move to two dimensions, and compute the 
% gravitational force between two lines. If these lines are
% separated by a distance y, we must integrate the function
IL = @(s,y) 2*(2-s).*(y./r(s,y)).*F_Point(r(s,y));
%%
% with respect to s, the length along the line. Near s=y=0 there 
% is a square root singularity, which we take care of with Chebfun's 
% "singmap" feature. See "help chebfun/maps" for more details.
F_Line = @(y) sum(chebfun(@(s) IL(s,y),[0 2], 'singmap',[0.5 0]));
F_Line = chebfun(@(y) F_Line(y), [0 sqrt(18)], ...
    'vectorise', 'exps',[-1.5 0], 'singmap',[0.5 0])
%%
% Note that here we actually construct a chebfun of F_Line. Since
% the integral of IL is quite costly to evaluate but simple enough 
% to be represented with a low-degree chebfun, this turns out to be more 
% efficient. (Note also that sqrt(18) is the maximum separation of two 
% points within the cubes).

%%
% We next compute the force between two planes separated by a 
% distance y by considering them as a sequence of lines. Using
% F_Line, the force between two lines computed above, and 
% integrating over all such lines, we find F_Plane, the force
% between the two planes.
IP = @(s,y) 2*(2-s).*(y./r(s,y)).*F_Line(r(s,y));
F_Plane = @(y) sum(chebfun(@(s) IP(s,y), [0 2],'singmap', [0.5 0]));
% F_Plane = chebfun(@(y) F_Plane(y), [0 4], ...
%    'vectorise', 'exps',[-1.5 0], 'singmap',[0.5 0]);

%%
% To compute the force between two cubes, we integrate over the 
% planes which form them using the force computed above. Here we 
% get two equations, one representing planes which are separated 
% by at most a distance of two, and the other for planes separated 
% by 2 to 4 units.
ICa = @(y) y*F_Plane(y);
ICb = @(y) (4-y)*F_Plane(y);

%%
% Now we do the actual computation -- integrating with respect
% to y.  Experiments 
% show we need to weaken the tolerance a little here, though the final 
% effect is minimal since the results are then integrated.
F_CubeA = sum(chebfun(ICa,[0 2],'vectorize','singmap',[0.25 0],'eps',1e-12));
F_CubeB = sum(chebfun(ICb,[2 4],'vectorize'));

%%
% Adding these results, and dividing by 16 to return to the original
% unit cube case, we arrive at the solution:
format long
F = (F_CubeA + F_CubeB)/16

% For comparison Fornberg has also found the exact solution analytically [1]:
exact = (26*pi/3 - 14 + 2*sqrt(2) - 4*sqrt(3) + 10*sqrt(5) - ...
    2*sqrt(6) + 26*log(2) - log(25) + 10*log(1+sqrt(2)) + ...
    20*log(1+sqrt(3)) - 35*log(1+sqrt(5)) + 6*log(1+sqrt(6)) - ...
    2*log(4+sqrt(6)) - 22*atan(2*sqrt(6)))/3
      
%%
% Here is the difference:
error = abs(F-exact)
